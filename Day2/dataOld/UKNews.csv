"1",2023-05-23,"The Government will be raising the subsidy rate for the National Tutoring Programme to 50% in 2023-24","
    
          
Half of tutoring costs will be funded through the National Tutoring Programme next year, doubling the government’s previous commitment to fund a quarter of the cost.

Initiated as part of the Government’s education recovery strategy and to help schools deliver a world-class education, the National Tutoring Programme has revolutionised how targeted support is offered in schools. Over three million courses have taken place so far, with school leaders reporting on the positive impact the programme is having on pupils’ attainment and confidence. This month, the Education Policy Institute also announced average outcomes in reading have largely been recovered in primary schools. And despite the disruption caused by the pandemic, England has risen to fourth internationally for primary reading proficiency in the recent Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) results.

Backed by over £1 billion across four years, £150 million will be available to schools next year. Whilst schools will continue to have the flexibility to decide which pupils to offer tutoring to, children from disadvantaged backgrounds will be prioritised as well as those who are below the expected standard or grade boundary in a particular subject.

Schools Minister, Nick Gibb, said:


  Since its inception in 2020, we have continuously evolved the National Tutoring Programme to ensure it works for pupils and schools.

  Over three million courses have been started as a result and we remain committed to supporting schools to embed tutoring long term because we know the positive impact it can have on pupils.

  That’s why I am pleased that next year, we will be able to match school’s funding contributions, whilst also supporting them more widely through a £2 billion boost in school funding.


Chief Secretary to the Treasury, John Glen, said:


  We want everyone in school to get a world-class education, enriching their own lives and strengthening the future workforce.

  Paying half of tutoring costs to support our young people through the National Tutoring Programme next year is clear evidence of that commitment and a down payment on long-term economic growth.


Nick Brook, CEO for the social mobility charity at Speakers for Schools and Chair of the DfE Strategic Tutoring Advisory Group, said:


  I’m pleased that the Government has listened to school and sector leaders and has agreed to raise the NTP subsidy to 50% next year. This will be welcome news to many schools, who have seen positive results from the programme and will want to continue offering tutoring next year.

  We know that tutoring can have a really positive effect on pupils’ attainment and confidence, and I welcome the renewed focus on supporting young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.


The Department for Education has always been clear that the subsidy rate for the programme will be tapered each year to support schools to embed tutoring long-term, moving from 75% in 2021-22 to a planned 25% in 2023-24.Following feedback from school leaders, the Government has now agreed a subsidy rate of 50% next year, to support schools to deliver the tutoring their pupils need.

To meet their costs when providing tutoring, schools will be able to continue to use funding streams like the pupil premium, which will rise to almost £2.9 billion in in 2023-24 – its highest ever level. The additional funding is thanks to the further £2 billion pounds being invested into schools. As a result, school funding is set to rise faster than forecast inflation in both 2023/24 and 2024/25.

Today we published new guidance about delivering tutoring next year. This is alongside information on the amount of funding each school will receive and a calculator tool to support schools to plan tutoring for next year. The Department for Education will also continue to support schools to embed tutoring into the long term as an integral part of the department’s strategy to raise standards in primary and secondary schools. This includes the ambitious target for 90 per cent of pupils to meet the expected standard of reading, writing and maths by the time they leave primary school.

"2",2023-05-22,"A father who ran an illegal waste business with his son at their home in Cornwall was sentenced to a suspended jail sentence by magistrates.","
    
          Michael Joseph Richards, 59, now living at Menorca Lane, Bugle, appeared for sentence on two charges relating to the illegal waste business that he and his son, also called Michael, ran at their then home at The Paddocks, St Stephen’s Road, Sticker.

Richards Senior was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison, suspended for two years, at Bodmin Magistrates Court on 18 May 2023.

Richards Junior was fined for three offences relating to the business last month. Richards Senior was also ordered to pay half of the £4,397.75 costs awarded previously.

In a case brought by the Environment Agency both men had admitted offences relating to running a waste site without a permit.

An investigation was launched by the Environment Agency following a fire at the site where building and household waste, including plasterboard, timber, cement bags, rigid insulation, electrical appliances, furniture and plastic household objects had been kept.

Surrounding the fire was more waste debris including radiators, fridges and a caravan. The fire was close to a gas tank and the main A390 road which meant there was the potential for causing a smoke hazard.

Magistrates said that waste crime is one of the worst types of offending that comes before them and that Richards failed to supervise what was happening on his land.

Following the hearing, Stephen Clark from the Environment Agency said:


  We’re pleased with the outcome of this case. Mr Richards Senior had a previous similar conviction. This sends out a message that waste crime will not be tolerated.


Background
Michael Richards Senior pleaded guilty to two charges:

Between 21 September 2020 and 25 June 2021, permitted the carrying on of a waste operation, on land known as The Paddocks, St Stephens Road, Sticker, St Austell in respect of which no environmental permit was in force.

Contrary to regulations 38(1)(b) and 12(1)(b) of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016

Between the 21 September 2020 and 25 June 2021, deposited, or knowingly caused or knowingly permitted the deposit of controlled waste including mixed building and household waste on land, namely The Paddocks, St Stephens Road, Sticker, St Austell, in respect of which no environmental permit was in force.

Contrary to section 33(1)(a) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.

Funding includes up to £25 million award to support the early development of new antibiotics, vaccines, rapid diagnostics and other products to combat life-threatening drug-resistant infections
  UK government launches the new Global Health Framework to build strong health systems across the world and tackle global health threats
Cutting-edge research initiatives to develop new treatments to tackle antimicrobial resistance (AMR) - known as the ‘silent killer’ - will receive a cash injection of up to £39 million from the UK government’s Global AMR Innovation Fund (GAMRIF).

AMR - where bacteria have evolved so much that antibiotics and other current treatments are no longer effective against infections - is a silent killer costing millions of lives across the world a year, with one in 5 of these deaths in children under the age of 5.

Of this new funding package, up to £24 million over 4 years has been awarded to bolster the UK’s partnership with CARB-X - a global AMR research initiative - to support the continued early development of invaluable new antibiotics, vaccines, rapid diagnostics and other products to combat life-threatening drug-resistant infections and prevent death and disease across the world.

The UK has already given £20 million of its ringfenced Official Development Assistance (ODA) budget to the initiative which, together with other funders, has resulted in CARB-X in turn investing nearly £40 million into the UK’s world-leading science and innovation industry.

In addition to the CARB-X grant, GAMRIF is investing £5 million over 2 years into the Global Antibiotic R&D Partnership (GARDP) to develop - and ensure global access to - new antibiotic treatments against major global health priorities.

The announcement comes as Health Minister Will Quince attends the World Health Assembly (WHA) in Geneva, Switzerland, and Development Minister Andrew Mitchell participates in an event on health leadership and climate change alongside the WHA. They will announce the launch of the UK government’s Global Health Framework for 2023 to 2025, as part of Minister Quince’s address at the WHA.

Health Minister Will Quince said:


  Antimicrobial resistance is a major threat to global health and has led to millions of tragic deaths per year, but the Global AMR Innovation Fund is supporting cutting-edge research and developing vital new treatments to prevent death and disease across the world.

  This funding will provide a much-needed boost to protect people from diseases such as drug-resistant gonorrhoea, life-threatening sepsis in newborn babies and serious bacterial infections.

  The UK is placing ourselves at the centre of the global health agenda and it’s fantastic to be in Geneva at the World Health Assembly to reinforce our commitment to improving health globally and building resilience against future health threats through our new Global Health Framework.


The framework will reaffirm the UK’s commitment to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - the goals adopted by all UN member states that recognise that ending poverty must go hand in hand with strategies that improve health and education - and ensuring that people in the UK and globally live healthier, safer and longer lives.

The key aims of the framework are to:

strengthen global health security through improving our preparedness and response to future epidemics, pandemics, drug-resistant infections, and climate change
  reform the global health architecture, including through a strengthened World Health Organization, to drive more coherent governance and collaboration across the international system
  strengthen country health systems and address key risk factors for ill health, working towards ending the preventable deaths of mothers, babies and children in the world’s poorest countries, and enabling women and girls to exercise their rights
  advance UK leadership in science and technology, strengthening the global health research base of UK and partner countries, while supporting trade and investment
The framework supports the UK’s engagement with international partners and organisations and will provide the opportunity to build on existing relationships and identify new opportunities for collaboration to tackle health threats around the world.

Foreign Minister Andrew Mitchell said:


  2023 is a critical moment towards the Sustainable Development Goals. The UK government has a proud history of leadership in global health.

  The UK is committed to creating strong and inclusive health systems globally, that help end the preventable deaths of mothers, babies and children and are resilient to global health threats.

  Through investment, innovation and engagement with key partners, we can develop a healthier, safer and more prosperous world for everyone.


A 4-year grant of up to £10 million has also been signed with Canada’s International Development Research Centre (IDRC). The GAMRIF-IDRC partnership, known as InnoVet-AMR, will identify solutions to reduce the emerging risk to global health and food security posed by AMR in animals.

Minister Quince will also meet with the Ministerial Alliance of Champions against AMR to discuss plans and priorities for tackling AMR over the next year. Minister Mitchell will attend a UK-led climate and health event alongside the WHA hosted with the Netherlands, UAE, Fiji and the World Bank with assistance from Wellcome Trust to highlight how the UK is helping accelerate action on climate and health.

          Vast majority of £150 payments set to be made automatically over two-week period between 20 June and 4 July 2023
  More than six million disabled people will receive payment and benefit from extra cost of living support
  Comes as part of wider package of Government support, including separate means-tested Cost of Living Payments totalling up to £900, and £300 Pensioner Payments
This follows the £150 Disability Cost of Living Payment that was paid last September, demonstrating the Government’s commitment to supporting the most vulnerable in society while delivering on its commitment to halve inflation this year and grow the economy.

Those being paid a disability benefit that qualifies them for the payment will receive it automatically during a two-week window starting on 20 June and finishing on 4 July.

At a time when costs are rising for everyone, this payment recognises the extra costs disabled people in particular often face, such as care and mobility needs.

A small proportion of payments will be made after this date, where claimants were still awaiting confirmation of their eligibility or entitlement to disability benefits on 1 April.

There will also be further payments of £300 for pensioners due later this year, meaning some of the most vulnerable households can receive up to £1,350 in direct Cost of Living Payments.

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Mel Stride MP, said:


  This payment helps protect those who need our support the most, providing a vital financial boost to six million disabled people.



  Our multi-billion-pound package of support reinforces our commitment to help UK households with the rising cost of living. It comes on top of record increases to benefits and the national living wage.


Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work, Tom Pursglove MP, said:


  We know the cost of living has gone up for disabled people, which is why we are taking action to reduce the financial pressures they face.



  This £150 Disability Cost of Living Payment is on top of up to £900 that most low-income benefit claimants will also receive, helping ensure the most vulnerable in our society are protected from rising costs during this challenging period.


The full list of benefit recipients that qualify for the upcoming Disability Cost of Living payment are those who receive:

Disability Living Allowance
  Personal Independence Payment
  Attendance Allowance
  Scottish Disability Benefits (Adult Disability Payment and Child Disability Payment)

26 innovative green finance projects awarded funding to make it easier to improve the energy efficiency of UK homes by unlocking upfront cash
  products receiving a share of £4.1 million include mortgages that reward energy efficiency upgrades and loans linked to installing heat pumps
  retrofitted properties could potentially save more than £460 a year on bills


Homeowners who make their properties more energy efficient could see their mortgage rate cut under a new government-backed pilot.

Perenna Bank will receive more than £193,000 in government funding to help develop their long-term, fixed-rate mortgage that will incentivise customers to make their homes more energy efficient by offering to reduce their mortgage rate.

Another trial will see buy-to-let landlords add the cost of making properties more energy efficient onto their mortgage – enabling them to borrow the money for the improvements and include it in their monthly repayments.

Ashman Bank Limited will be awarded £200,000 to design and develop this, which will assess a property’s energy efficiency, provide options on how it can be improved and incorporate the cost of carrying out the work on to the duration of the mortgage.

The projects are among 26 green finance products being developed and tested, backed by £4.1 million of government funding.

They are aimed at encouraging and helping homeowners make their properties more energy efficient, with measures such as loft insulation and double glazing. This in turn will help them save more than £460 a year on their energy bills – one of many ways the government is helping ease the cost of living for families across the country.

Lord Callanan, Minister for Energy Efficiency and Green Finance, said:


  The government has put in place long-term commitments to ensure homes across the country have greater energy efficiency to reduce bills, drive down energy use and lower emissions.

  We are supporting these organisations to develop fresh and innovative ways of helping more people get better access to energy efficiency measures, such as loft insulation, double glazing and heat pumps.


Other projects successful in bidding for funding include Aviva Equity Release UK Limited, who will receive £87,612 to design a service that allows homeowners to access equity in their property through a specialist lifetime mortgage, freeing up cash to improve the energy efficiency of their homes.

Clydesdale Bank PLC, trading as Virgin Money, will receive £171,000 for a product that will offer bespoke energy efficiency products for customers’ properties, after carrying out a survey to outline the improvements needed.

Scott Brown, Head of Equity Release Pricing at Aviva, another winning project, said:


  Aviva is delighted to have secured funding from the government to explore building a green mortgage solution for later life lending.

  Aviva and the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero will co-fund our customer research to explore the development, which will aim to enable later life households to make home energy efficiency improvements, making their homes more comfortable to live in, reducing energy bills and helping drive a reduction in the carbon footprint of the UK’s housing stock.

  Given the value in the research being produced, Aviva commit to sharing the output when finalised with the wider industry to support industry level change.


Craig Calder, head of secured lending at Virgin Money, one of the winning projects, said:


  To be part of the innovative Green Home Finance Accelerator project is important for Virgin Money as we look to reinforce our aspiration to halve our financed emissions by 2030 and deliver net zero by 2050.

  Working with industry experts Sero and Rightmove is an opportunity to research, test and learn what consumers want before we take a proposition to market – enabling us to provide a great product for customers while at the same time making a positive impact on the environment.


Following a 6-month Discovery Phase period, all 26 Green Home Finance Accelerator projects will be able to apply for larger grant awards, between £200,000 and £2 million to enable them to pilot their green finance products and services.

Investments announced today form part of the £20 million Green Home Finance Accelerator, which is funded through the £1 billion Net Zero Innovation Portfolio. Funding will help drive wider government efforts to ensure as many homes as possible reach an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) band C by 2035, with higher ratings likely to result in lower fuel bills.

Based on a standard occupancy and heating regime, owner-occupiers improving their homes to EPC C could save over £460 a year on their energy bills.

£2 bus fare extended until 31 October to help passengers with cost of living and then £2.50 until November 2024
  new £300 million government investment will protect bus services into 2025 and keep travel affordable
  funding boost will support the bus sector’s long-term recovery, taking total investment for buses to more than £3.5 billion since March 2020


Millions of passengers across England will continue to ‘Get Around for £2’ and access vital bus services thanks to £500 million in government funding, supporting people with the cost of living and ensuring long-term stability in the sector.

The Transport Secretary Mark Harper today (17 May 2023) confirmed £300 million to protect vital routes and improve services until 2025 that people rely on for work, education, medical appointments and shopping.

To help people with cost of living pressures and save on everyday travel costs, the government will also provide up to £200 million to continue capping single bus fares at £2 outside London until the end of October 2023 and then at £2.50 until 30 November 2024 – when the government will review their effectiveness and future bus fares.

The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimates that inflation will be halved by the end of this year, and capping fares at £2.50 until November 2024 will create longer-term certainty for bus users over the next year. The fare cap will be reviewed ahead of November 2024.

The move is an essential part of the government’s Help for Households initiative to support everyone through the increased cost of living, and will particularly benefit those on lower incomes who take nearly 3 times as many bus trips than those on higher incomes.

During the pandemic, bus usage dropped as low as 10% of pre-pandemic levels and, while passenger levels have recovered to around 85 to 90%, the fare cap aims to encourage people back on the bus, which can help reduce congestion and emissions.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said:


  By extending the £2 fare cap, we’re making sure bus travel remains accessible and affordable for everyone while helping to ease cost of living pressures.

  Buses connect our communities and play a vital role in growing the economy; they transport people to work, take our kids to school and make sure patients can get to doctors’ appointments.

  That’s why we’re determined to protect local routes and encourage more people onto the bus, ensuring people can get around easily and in an affordable way.


Transport Secretary Mark Harper said:


  Taking the bus is the most popular form of public transport and millions of people rely on these vital services every day.

  That’s why we’re investing half a billion pounds to help people save money amid cost of living pressures and continue to level up transport in all parts of the country, doing our bit to help halve inflation and grow the economy.


Graham Vidler, CEO of the Confederation of Passenger Transport, said:


  We welcome this 2-year funding settlement. It shows a recognition of the value of buses to the economy and to local communities. It will enable bus operators and local authorities to plan, promote and grow services with greater confidence.

  However, the combination of the funding settlement and the £2 fare cap extension will not save every service in every part of the country. Operators and local authorities will now work together to study the detail of the government’s proposals and ensure that the funding is used to safeguard the best possible network for local passengers.


Some of the biggest savings on the longest routes up and down the country thanks to the fare cap include:

Journey
      Normal fare
      Amount saved
      % saving
     Lancaster to Kendal
      £14.50
      £12.50
      86%
     Plymouth to Exeter
      £11.20
      £9.20
      82%
    Newcastle to Middlesbrough
      £8.00
      £6.00
      75%
    Hull to York
      £8.50
      £6.50
      76%
    Leeds to Scarborough
      £15.00
      £13.00
      87%
    While initially introduced only as a temporary measure, we are extending the £2 fare cap for the second time to continue helping people save money on travel. Since it started on 1 January this year, the £2 fare has encouraged more people to use the bus.

Operators such as Go-Ahead have carried more than 16 million passengers at £2 since 1 January 2023, helping them save on average a third off fares. Bus operators that are continuing the £2 fare cap scheme will be confirmed in due course.

The additional funding announced today will be shared between local transport authorities and bus operators to protect and improve routes across England and demonstrates our commitment to returning bus sector to a long-term sustainable financial footing. The new funding models will protect vulnerable routes while allowing local authorities and operators to determine the routes that work for local areas.

This builds on over 3 years’ worth of government support totalling over £2 billion to help the sector recover from the pandemic, and more than £1 billion to support local authorities deliver their long-term local plans to improve services.

As part of the £300 million to support services until 2025, £160 million will be provided to local transport authorities to improve fares, services and infrastructure while £140 million will go directly to operators to help protect essential services across England.

While it is the responsibility of bus operators and local transport authorities to ensure an adequate provision of bus routes, the government continues to work closely with the sector to support local areas in dealing with changing travel patterns while managing pressures on the taxpayer.

This latest funding is part of a multi-billion holistic programme of government support for the bus sector. In 2021, the government published the National Bus Strategy and asked all English local transport authorities outside London to set out their bus service improvement plans (BSIPs) explaining their local visions for the step-change in bus services that are needed to put passengers back at the heart of the network.

Since then, over £1 billion has been awarded to 34 counties, city regions and unitary authorities to deliver service improvements, bus priority measures and ambitious fares initiatives, including local fare caps in Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and Liverpool City Region.

In addition, £5.7 billion investment has been provided to 8 mayoral combined authorities in England to support integrated, cross-modal transport networks over the next 5 years through the City Region Sustainable Transport Settlement (CRSTS), including supporting bus infrastructure.

As part of the National Bus Strategy, the government committed to achieving a zero-emission bus (ZEB) fleet. Since February 2020, we have supported an estimated 3,400 ZEBs across the UK, including a near £300 million investment for up to 1,400 ZEBs in England outside London, taking the vision of a net zero transport network closer to reality.

In our session ‘Retirement calculator – the power of Python’, attendees learned about our interactive calculator for public service pension schemes. GAD developed the calculator following the McCloud legal ruling, which impacts over 3 million public servants.

The judgment means that some public service pension scheme members will have to make a choice between the benefits provided by 2 different schemes. Our calculator helps these members to make an informed decision.

To provide the best possible experience, the calculator was created in Python, allowing different parameters to be set and enabling complex numerical information to be presented in a simple graphical format.

As well as learning about the possible implications of the McCloud legal case on public service pensions, attendees found out how Python can result in user-friendly interfaces and great data visualisation.

Analyst Sam Kinshuck said: “Our innovative retirement calculator is being used by public service pension schemes across the UK.

“Attendees at this session viewed a demonstration of the calculator, learned about the possible implications of the McCloud legal case, and saw the power of Python.”

Saving lives and livelihoods

Our webinar, ‘Disaster risk financing – how analysis can contribute to timely responses’ offered insights about how disaster risk finance works. Disaster risk financing provides ways in which countries can be supported to find better ways to stop disasters devastating lives and livelihoods.

In this talk, actuaries from GAD set out how analytical work for our clients has contributed to improving people’s lives post-disaster. We included case studies of projects that GAD have worked on, such as modelling droughts in Sub-Saharan Africa.

As well as discovering how analysis is applied to disaster risk financing, attendees learned how working together in multidisciplinary teams creates solutions and makes an impact.

Charlotte Stewart, actuary and lead presenter, said: “Pre-planned disaster risk financing can reduce the impact on people of disasters, and newer techniques like anticipatory action can mean actions can be taken before the disaster even hits.

“The cost of response can also be reduced by responding more quickly and in pre-planned ways aligned to the needs of those affected. This is supported by a range of analytical approaches including the use of data science, satellite monitoring, catastrophe models and more.”

"9",2023-05-16,"UKHSA has launched a 10-year science strategy, setting out how UKHSA’s science can save more lives and contribute to the UK’s ambition to be a global science superpower.","
    
          The strategy sets out how the UK Health Security Agency’s (UKHSA) scientific capabilities – including genomics, vaccine evaluation, surveillance, data science, diagnostics and toxicology – will be deployed to prepare for future health security hazards, respond to current threats to save lives, reduce harm, protect livelihoods and essentially build the UK’s health security capacity.

Through investment in scientific workforce and deeper partnerships with industry and academia, the strategy sets out UKHSA’s ambitions to:

predict and anticipate health threats, through unique and expert skills in genomics, data science and surveillance, including disease vector (such as mosquitoes and ticks) surveillance
  create a more secure environment, by enhancing our understanding of the threats in the environment and building scientific defences against these hazards
  reduce and eliminate health threats, by strengthening the scientific evidence underpinning health protection programmes – at home and abroad
  act on the scientific evidence, translating data, knowledge and insights into practical actions
  unlock the potential of scientific assets, and secure the legacy from the pandemic to increase the impact of our science on health and economic prosperity, strengthening vaccine and diagnostic development and evaluation and data science
Professor Isabel Oliver, Chief Scientific Advisor at UKHSA, said:


  We saw the art of the possible during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic with genomic data allowing the rapid identification and characterisation of variants enabling the rapid development and evaluation of diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics.

  Science was the backbone of the world’s response, helping us to understand the virus, how to best protect ourselves and ultimately live safely with the virus. UKHSA will deploy its unique scientific capabilities working with partners to protect lives and livelihoods from the health threats we are facing now and those we will detect, prevent and control in future.


Professor Dame Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of UKHSA, said:


  UKHSA protects our communities from infectious diseases and the impact of chemical, radiological and other environmental health hazards. Our diverse scientific capabilities and partnerships are the foundation of our work, underpinning everything we do.

  We are already working to continuously protect the public from existing and emerging health threats, but our new strategy will ensure the UK is ready to tackle all current and future health threats quickly and effectively, securing the best health outcomes and greater prosperity for the country.


Health Minister Maria Caulfield said:


  Cutting-edge science showed its power throughout our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and will continue to protect people from potential future health threats.

  UKHSA’s new science strategy will ensure the UK remains one of the world’s science superpowers, while protecting people from illness and reducing pressure on NHS services – helping to deliver on the government’s priority of cutting waiting lists.


Minister of State at the new Department for Science, Innovation and Technology George Freeman MP said:


  The COVID-19 pandemic was a wake-up call for the importance of health economic resilience and security with big lessons for enhanced pathogen detection, biosecurity, pandemic preparedness and better understanding of the real drivers of health economic resilience. As well as learning why some populations, from cities to entire countries, were remarkably more resilient than others, as revealed by the work of the G20 Reform for Resilience Commission.

  UK leadership in pathogen sensing, rapid genomic sequencing, vaccine manufacturing and clinical informatics proved to be vital in saving millions of lives.

  The UK’s major investment in life sciences in the last 10 years has paid dividends and helped attract billions of new investment in mRNA drug and vaccine technologies, and clinical trials.

  This is why it’s so important for UKHSA to have a clear scientific capabilities plan, which builds on the investments we are already making to support this vital £94 billion life sciences sector, including most recently the £350 million joint government and industry backing for life sciences manufacturing in the last 2 years alone, our commitment to double funding for dementia research to £160 million a year by 2024 to 2025, and £50 million funding for medical research charities.

  Health security is economic security: for the UK and the globe.


Through this work, the agency will identify and address threats rapidly, protecting people’s health and livelihoods, reducing the burden on NHS services and ultimately limiting the costs associated with major outbreaks and incidents.

Our developments include a new Centre for Climate and Health Security, including delivering a 5-year assessment report on the Health Effects of Climate Change. In addition, UKHSA is working in partnership to accelerate and expand its role in new diagnostics and developing the organisation’s genomic capabilities to detect threats to health rapidly and effectively, as well as supporting the development of the vaccines and therapeutics that we need to protect health.

"11",2023-05-15,"The CMA today updated on the action it is taking to help contain rising cost of living pressures in road fuel and groceries.","
    
          Whilst many of the factors driving price increases are not competition related, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has a vital role to play in giving consumers assurance that competition in critical markets is working well, so they can exercise choice with confidence.

Road fuel

The CMA is today providing an update on the Road Fuel market study it began last year.

While the evidence shows that the majority of fuel price increases are due to global factors, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine, indications are that higher pump prices cannot be attributed solely to factors outside the control of the retailers. Based on evidence gathered as part of the Road Fuel market study, the higher prices drivers are paying at the pumps appear in part to reflect some weakening of competition in the road fuel retail market.

Evidence gathered by the CMA indicates that fuel margins have increased across the retail market, but in particular for supermarkets, over the past 4 years. As a result of these increasing margins, average 2022 supermarket pump prices appear to be around 5 pence per litre more expensive than they would have been had their average percentage margins remained at 2019 levels.

Although supermarkets still tend to be the cheapest retail suppliers of fuel, evidence from internal documents indicates that at least one supermarket has significantly increased its internal forward-looking margin targets over this period. Other supermarkets have recognised this change in approach and may have adjusted their pricing behaviour accordingly.

The CMA is also concerned that it may be seeing evidence of weaker competition in diesel, as compared with petrol, since the beginning of 2023. While some degree of variation in diesel retail margin is to be expected given the high levels of volatility in diesel wholesale prices, the high margins in 2023 appear to have gone on longer than would be expected. The CMA needs to understand whether weaker competition is part of the explanation for this.

Whilst the level of engagement with the study has varied across supermarkets, we are not satisfied that they have all been sufficiently forthcoming with the evidence they have provided. In particular, important information has only been received late in the day and after several rounds of information gathering. Given the concerns we have about a market of such importance to millions of drivers it is vital we get to the bottom of what is going on.

The CMA will now conduct formal interviews with the supermarkets’ senior management in order to get to the heart of the issues. We will issue our final report no later than 7 July 2023, covering the full range of issues we have considered in this market and setting out any further action that we think is needed.

Groceries

As cost of living pressures have grown, the CMA has been working to understand how well markets in essential goods and services are working. Along with road fuel, we identified groceries as an early priority, and we started work earlier this year looking into unit pricing practices online and instore.

While global factors have also been the main driver of grocery price increases, and at this stage the CMA has not seen evidence pointing to specific competition concerns in the grocery sector, it is important to be sure that weak competition is not adding to the problems.

Given ongoing concerns about high prices, we are announcing the stepping up of our work in the grocery sector to understand whether any failure in competition is contributing to grocery prices being higher than they would be in a well-functioning market.

The prices that consumers pay for their groceries are the result of competition at three main levels of the market:

Competition between retailers, where consumers shop for their products.
  Competition between suppliers who make the products and sell them to the retailers.
  Competition between raw material providers who provide the inputs to food suppliers.
Given the need to provide findings swiftly, the CMA will do this work in a targeted way, focusing on those areas where people are experiencing greatest cost of living pressures.

This new phase of our work will therefore cover:

First, completing work to assess how competition is working overall in the grocery retail market, drawing on publicly available data and other information.
  Second, in parallel, identifying which product categories, if any, might merit closer examination across the supply chain.
The CMA will engage with a wide range of industry participants, experts, and other stakeholder groups to inform our assessment. We will provide an update on this work over the coming months.

Sarah Cardell, Chief Executive of the CMA, said:


  The rising cost of living is putting people and businesses under sustained financial pressure. The CMA is determined to do what it can to ensure competition helps contain these pressures as much as possible.

  Our Road Fuel market study is nearly complete. Although much of the pressure on pump prices is down to global factors including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we have found evidence that suggests weakening retail competition is contributing to higher prices for drivers at the pumps.  We are also concerned about the sustained higher margins on diesel compared to petrol we have seen this year.

  We are not satisfied that all the supermarkets have been sufficiently forthcoming with the evidence they have provided in our Road Fuel market study, so we will be calling them in for formal interviews to get to the bottom of what is going on. It is a priority for the CMA to publish a full and final report, including recommendations for action, by the beginning of July.

  Grocery and food shopping are essential purchases. We recognise that global factors are behind many of the grocery price increases, and we have seen no evidence at this stage of specific competition problems. But, given ongoing concerns about high prices, we are stepping up our work in the grocery sector to help ensure competition is working well and people can exercise choice with confidence.


Notes to editors

The CMA has today published a document on its work to contain cost of living pressures.
  More information is available on the CMA’s Road Fuel market study.

The Student Loans Company (SLC) is reminding new students in England, who are planning to attend university and college this autumn, to submit their student finance applications right away.

With the new student application deadline approaching on 19th May*, students should apply online now even if they don’t have a confirmed place at university.  This will ensure their finance is in place for the start of the academic year.

The Student Loans Company (SLC) paid over 1.5 million students more than £22bn in maintenance loans, grants and tuition fees in the last completed academic year (21/22). Given the scale of the service it offers, it’s important that students’ applications are submitted and ready to be processed.

Jackie Currie, Executive Director Operations at SLC, said: “We understand that prospective students have a lot on right now, with studying and exams on the horizon. However, my message to them is apply now because getting their student finance application in before the deadline gives them one less thing to think about during the important study period. And even if they don’t know what course or university they are going to, or if they are waiting for exam results, please still apply”.

Students can apply for Tuition Fee Loans to cover fees and Maintenance Loans to help with living costs. There may be circumstances where a student is able to access some extra money, for example if they have additional needs, have children, or are studying for a medical, social work or teaching course. More information about what is available can be found here - https://www.gov.uk/student-finance/extra-help

Important information for prospective students:

There are a number of resources available for students to find out more on how to apply and about the financial support that might be available.

Full information, including guides on how to apply, what funding is available and videos to help students through the application process are available at: https://studentfinance.campaign.gov.uk/

  Students can apply for Tuition Fee Loans to cover fees and Maintenance Loans to help with living costs. There is a student finance calculator to estimate entitlement: https://www.gov.uk/student-finance-calculator

  Students can also access more information and guidance on Gov.UK, The Student Room and by following Student Finance England at facebook.com/SFEngland, twitter.com/SF_England or youtube/SFEFILM

  If the current tax year’s household income drops by 15% or more compared to the 21/22 tax year the student may be entitled to receive more maintenance loan, more info here: https://www.gov.uk/support-child-or-partners-student-finance-application/current-year-income

Have important documents to hand:

Students should have their National Insurance Number and passport details to hand before starting the application.
  They will also be asked for bank details when applying, including the 8-digit account number and 6-digit sort code.  If the bank details change after applying, it’s quick and easy to log into their online account and update them.
Track the progress of the application:

Applications can take six to eight weeks to process, and students do not need to contact us during this time. They can track the status of their application via their online accounts and will be notified if there are any outstanding actions they need to take.  Students can also make changes to their personal information in their online accounts.
Returning students are also reminded to apply before their application deadline on 23 June.

"13",2023-05-11,"Transport Secretary has announced he will not renew or extend Transpennine Express's contract. ","
    
          

Transpennine Express’s contract will not be renewed on 28 May 2023
  Secretary of State for Transport asks northern mayors to work with the government to improve services for passengers
  comes as single-leg pricing is extended across most of LNER network resulting in simpler, more flexible tickets that offer better value


The Transport Secretary has today (11 May 2023) announced he will not renew or extend Transpennine Express’s (TPE) contract at the end of the month. This will bring the company into operator of last resort (OLR) from 28 May 2023.

The decision follows months of significant disruption and regular cancellations across Transpennine Express’s network, which has resulted in a considerable decline in confidence for passengers who rely on the trains to get to work, visit family and friends and go about their daily lives.

Alongside the train operating company, the Department for Transport (DfT) has taken steps to improve services, putting the operator on a recovery plan in February and meeting with local mayors to discuss a way forward.

While some improvements have been made over the past few months, it has been decided that to achieve the performance levels passengers deserve, and that the northern economy needs, both the contract and the underlying relationships must be reset.

While making the decision to bring Transpennine Express into operator of last resort, the department recognises that a significant number of problems facing TPE stem from matters out of its control. These include a backlog of recruitment and training drivers, reforming how the workforce operates and most notably, ASLEF’s decision to withdraw rest day working – preventing drivers from taking on overtime shifts and filling in gaps on services.

The decision to bring Transpennine Express into the control of the operator of last resort is temporary and it is the government’s full intention that it will return to the private sector.

In light of this, today’s decision will not instantaneously resolve the challenges being faced on the lines, but will provide an opportunity to reset relationships between the operator, staff, trade unions and passengers.

As part of this and in response to stakeholders’ calls for action, the Transport Secretary has asked the Department for Transport to review services in the north to help drive efficiency and find better ways to deliver for passengers across the region. He also asks all interested parties including the northern mayors and Transport for the North to engage with the government on this work.

The government continues to urge the union to call off upcoming strikes and the rest day working ban.

Transport Secretary, Mark Harper said:


  In my time as Transport Secretary, I have been clear that passenger experience must always come first. After months of commuters and Northern businesses bearing the brunt of continuous cancellations, I’ve made the decision to bring Transpennine Express into operator of last resort.

  This is not a silver bullet and will not instantaneously fix a number of challenges being faced, including ASLEF’s actions which are preventing Transpennine Express from being able to run a full service – once again highlighting why it’s so important that the railways move to a 7-day working week.

  We have played our part, but ASLEF now need to play theirs by calling off strikes and the rest day working ban, putting the very fair and reasonable pay offer to a democratic vote of their members.


Under operator of last resort, services will run as normal with no changes to tickets, timetables or planned services with the department committed to ensuring a seamless transition for passengers.

The decision on TPE comes as LNER today announced, after a successful trial, single leg pricing will be extended across most of their network from 11 June 2023, with tickets going on sale this Sunday.

From mid-June 2023, LNER passengers will benefit from simpler, more flexible, and better value ticketing as part of government’s plans to improve services for passengers and bring the railways into the 21st century.

Single-leg-pricing – which consists of removing return tickets in favour of single-leg tickets priced at around half the cost of the old return ticket – will simplify outdated and complicated ticketing practices.

This means people will no longer have to choose between buying a return ticket – which may not suit their plans – or taking the risk of buying 2 singles which could individually cost just £1 less than a return ticket.

For example, a person wanting to buy an off-peak single from Peterborough to Newcastle on the day of travel will now pay £63.70 as opposed to £121.50 which saves almost £60.

This follows on from the Secretary of State setting out his ambition for the rail sector at the George Bradshaw address earlier this year, reiterating his commitment to modernising the railways to ensure their commercial and financial sustainability for years to come.

"14",2023-05-09,"All pensioners on a low income should check if they qualify for Pension Credit in order to also receive a Cost of Living Payment.","
    
          Pensioners urged to check if they could be eligible for Pension Credit, worth over £3,500 a year on average
  Those who successfully claim by 19 May could also receive a £301 Cost of Living payment – demonstrating Government’s focus on delivering the five priorities, including halving inflation, growing the economy and reducing debt
  Pensioners can check their eligibility and get an estimate of what they may receive by using the online Pension Credit calculator

There are just ten days to go for people to claim Pension Credit and still qualify for the latest £301 payment, which they will receive direct into their bank accounts.

Provided a claim is made before 19 May, it can be backdated for up to three months so long as the applicant was also eligible to receive it during that time.

This builds on the extensive support that was delivered to pensioners last year, alongside measures such as holding down households’ energy bills and freezing fuel and alcohol duty, which deliver on Government’s priorities to halve inflation and grow the economy.

Minister for Pensions Laura Trott said:

“Pension Credit can make a real difference and I am determined to make sure this support – worth an average of £3,500 a year – is reaching everyone who needs it, particularly as we know how much pressure households across the country have been under.

“Please check if you or your loved ones can claim for this extra support, and if you do it by 19 May you could qualify for the £301 Cost of Living Payment – giving another financial boost to those who need it most.”

Pension Credit is designed to help people over State Pension age and on a low income with daily living costs, though you do not need to be in receipt of State Pension to receive it.

It tops up a person’s income to a minimum of £201.05 per week for single pensioners and to £306.85 for couples or more if a person has a disability or caring responsibilities.

Worth on average over £3,500 a year, even a small Pension Credit award can provide access to a wide range of other benefits – such as help with housing costs, council tax or heating bills – in addition to the extra cost of living payments, worth up to £900 this financial year.

"15",2023-05-03,"99% of households initially eligible through DWP will have been directly paid £301 by the government by end of today (3 May 2023).","
    
          The payments are the first of 3 new Cost of Living Payments worth up to £900 in 2023/24 for those eligible – though some people will receive up to £1,350.
  Those remaining will continue to be paid between now and 17 May by DWP, with no need to contact anyone.
More than 7 million households across the UK will have been paid a £301 Cost of Living Payment by the end of today (3 May 2023).

This means the vast majority of eligible households have received the support in just 8 days of the rollout starting, with the small number of payments outstanding to be made by 17 May.

The payment is the first of 3 Cost of Living Payments being made this year and the next, illustrating the government’s commitment to supporting vulnerable families with financial pressures. This comes alongside work to deliver on the government’s 5 priorities, including halving inflation and growing the economy, which will ultimately help put more money in people’s bank accounts at the end of the month.

Mel Stride, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, said:


  Paying more than 7 million households £301 in a little over a week underlines our commitment to ensure those on the lowest income are protected from the worst of rising prices and give them peace of mind.

  With further payments due to be made later this year and in 2024, we will continue to provide support to those who need it most while we tackle inflation and grow the economy.


Jeremy Hunt, Chancellor of the Exchequer, added:


  We know the impact that rising prices are having on families, which is why we are providing significant support to millions through these direct cash payments. This is alongside other support, including holding down energy bills, uplifting benefits and the State Pension by 10%, and increasing the National Living Wage by a record amount.

  The single best way to ease cost of living pressures is to bear down on inflation. We are on track to halve it this year, laying the foundation for the long-term growth needed to improve everyone’s living standards.


The Cost of Living Payments, spread across 2023/24, are worth up to £900 for those on means-tested benefits. The next payment for those on means-tested benefits is due in the autumn, with the third instalment due next spring.

These are accompanied by a £150 payment for people on eligible disability benefits this summer, and a £300 payment to top up Winter Fuel Payments for pensioners at the end of 2023 – meaning some will receive up to £1,350.

This makes up part of the government’s significant cost of living support – now worth an average of £3,300 per household over this year and last.

People will be eligible for the £301 Cost of Living Payment if they have been entitled to a payment for one of 7 benefits between 26 January and 25 February 2023. The eligible benefits are:

Universal Credit
  Pension Credit
  Income-based Jobseekers Allowance
  Income-related Employment and Support Allowance
  Income Support
  Working Tax Credit
  Child Tax Credit
The DWP encourages anyone who thinks they may be eligible for a qualifying benefit to use a benefits calculator to check their entitlement. In particular, low-income pensioners should check their eligibility for Pension Credit, as they may still be able to receive the £301 Cost of Living Payment, and subsequent payments, if they make a successful backdated application by 19 May 2023.

The small number of payments outstanding will continue to be made between now and 17 May, and anyone eligible still waiting for a payment does not need to contact the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) before then.

After this date, if someone thinks they may be missing a payment they are entitled to, a form can be filled out on the GOV.UK website to make a claim.

One million eligible families, receiving tax credits only, will get their £301 Cost of Living Payment from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) between Tuesday 2 and Tuesday 9 May with the banking reference ‘HMRC COLS’.

This payment comes on top of extensive support given to low-income households in 2022, including up to £1,100 in Cost of Living Payments. The Household Support Fund, worth over £2 billion across its lifetime, continues to offer support to people across England, and those in need should contact their local council to see what support is available in their area.

Notes to Editors

These payments will all be tax-free, will not count towards the benefit cap, and will not have any impact on existing benefit awards.

The 3 means-tested Cost of Living Payments, worth up to £900 in total, are being delivered in 3 slightly different amounts, each relating to a specific qualifying period before the payment is made. This allows DWP and HMRC to ensure support is targeted at those who need it and are eligible, to determine if a payee received the correct payments and identify the payment value and to reduce the risk of fraud.

To get the £301 payment someone must (subject to a very limited exception explained below) have been entitled to a payment of, or later found to have been entitled to a payment of, a qualifying benefit as follows:

for Universal Credit, payment in respect of an assessment period ending between the 26 January 2023 to the 25 February 2023
  for all other DWP means-tested benefits, payment in respect of any day between 26 January and 25 February 2023
  for tax credit-only customers to be eligible they must have received a payment of tax credits in respect of any day in the period 26 January 2023 to 25 February 2023, or later be found to have been entitled to a payment for this period
  those on DWP benefits other than Universal Credit who are entitled to less than 10 pence and meet all other qualifying criteria but who do not receive a benefit payment, will still receive a Cost of Living Payment
More than 6 million people on qualifying disability benefits will receive a Disability Cost of Living Payment of £150 during summer 2023. This includes those in receipt of one of the following benefits:

Disability Living Allowance
  Personal Independence Payment
  Attendance Allowance
  Scottish Disability Benefits
  Armed Forces Independence Payment
  Constant Attendance Allowance
  War Pension Mobility Supplement
The £300 Pensioner Cost of Living Payment will be paid to all households in receipt of Winter Fuel Payments, in the same way as 2022/23 payments were made.

Payment windows and eligibility dates for the remaining Cost of Living Payments will be announced in due course.

"16",2023-04-27,"The Plan, developed by scientists and public health experts, brings together and improves existing guidance on weather and health.","
    
          The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has today launched a new combined Adverse Weather and Health Plan (AWHP) as part of a commitment under the climate change National Adaption Programme (NAP) to bring together and improve existing guidance on weather and health.

The AWHP will build on existing measures taken by UKHSA, the wider government, its agencies, NHS England and local authorities to protect people from the health effects of adverse weather and build community resilience.

Bringing together the previous Heatwave Plan for England, and the Cold Weather Plan for England, this new annual document will be underpinned by:

a collection of supporting scientific evidence, published in parallel
  updated Weather-Health alerts developed in partnership with the Met Office
  new and updated guidance and supporting materials, providing advice on how to stay safe during severe weather events, such as periods of extreme heat and cold
The AWHP was developed by scientists and public health experts in the UKHSA’s new Centre for Climate and Health Security, established to provide leadership to protect health in the context of a changing climate and provide a focus for partnerships and collaborations with academia, local authorities and other public sector organisations.

Dr Agostinho Sousa, Head of Extreme Events and Health Protection at UKHSA, said:


  The publication of this Plan demonstrates UKHSA’s commitment to keep the public healthy and safe by setting out the actions the government are taking to address the risks posed by climate change. It builds on existing measures taken by government, NHS England and local authorities to protect individuals and communities from the health effects of extreme weather.

  As we go forward, we will continue to update this ambitious Plan to ensure it is supported by strong and reliable evidence as we continue to tackle the public health threats posed by adverse weather.


Stephen Groves, NHS England Director of Emergency Preparedness and Resilience, said:


  The NHS needs to be able to plan for and respond to a wide range of incidents and emergencies which could affect the public’s health or patient care, and this includes severe and adverse weather.

  We will be working alongside UKHSA, government and local authorities to ensure that robust plans are in place to ensure safe care continues to be available and to protect the public during any extreme weather.


UKHSA is working with the Met Office to create a new dedicated platform for heat health alerts to support the Plan, to be launched June 2023, and for cold health alerts to be launched by November 2023.

The dedicated platform for adverse weather and health events will see UKHSA move towards impact-based alerts, consistent with and complementary to the existing Met Office National Severe Weather Warning Service.

These alerts will contain information on the weather conditions expected in the coming days, an outline of the impacts that are expected and an overview of the regional impact assessment. They are underpinned by guidance advising NHS and social care organisations and professionals on the actions they should take to keep the public healthy and safe under different levels of alerts.

Will Lang, Head of Situational Awareness at the Met Office, said:


  We are looking forward to working even more closely with UKHSA following the implementation of the new combined Adverse Weather and Health Plan. It is only by working in close partnerships with organisations like UKHSA that effective action can be taken when it matters.

  This Plan builds on the work we have already been doing together. The updated Weather-Health alerts will be complementary to and run alongside our National Severe Weather Warnings and will play a pivotal role in helping save lives, protect property and the economy as we all work to tackle adverse weather and climate change going forward.


Councillor David Fothergill, Chairman of the Local Government Association’s Community Wellbeing Board, said:


  Severe and adverse weather has a big impact on our local communities, whether it be on our infrastructure or on the health of our most vulnerable residents.

  We now understand more about the impact that extreme weather can have on the health of our communities and councils have worked hard to help those who need it the most during these periods.

  As experts predict extreme weather will become more common in years to come, this Plan will help to co-ordinate organisations to protect the health and wellbeing of everyone from the effects of severe temperatures.


The updated supporting evidence also summarises a series of further actions that would support climate change mitigation and adaptation.

According to the report produced by the Climate Change Committee as part of the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 3 (CCRA3), the projected total economic costs of heat-related mortality from climate change in England in this decade amounts to approximately £6.4 billion per year.

Furthermore, this report identified several early adaptation investments that deliver higher value for money. According to the Monetary Valuation of Risks and Opportunities in CCRA3, every £1 invested in heatwave planning or Weather and Climate Services could result in £10 in economic benefits.

Some of these benefits refer specifically to the adaptation measures detailed in the Plan, including heatwave planning, early warning systems and capacity building.

"18",2023-04-25,"This is first of three new Cost of Living payments adding up to £900 in 2023/24 – though some people will receive up to £1,350.","
    
          Over 8 million households to receive £301 from the Government with payments hitting bank accounts from today
  Those eligible will be paid between Tuesday 25 April and Wednesday 17 May, with HMRC making payments to tax credit-only customers between Tuesday 2 and Tuesday 9 May
Over eight million households across the UK will receive a £301 Cost of Living Payment from the Government, with payments rolled out from today, demonstrating the Government’s relentless focus on our five priorities – including halving inflation, growing the economy and reducing debt.

As the cost of living continues to affect families across the UK, these payments are designed to target support towards the most vulnerable in society and provide them with a financial boost.

The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will send payments automatically and directly to recipients’ bank accounts, with a reference of their National Insurance number followed by ‘DWP COL’.

This is the first of up to three payments for those eligible on means-tested benefits, including Universal Credit, Pension Credit and tax credits, totalling £900 through 2023/24. These will be accompanied by a £150 payment for people on eligible disability benefits this summer, and a £300 payment on top of Winter Fuel Payments for pensioners at the end of 2023.

This builds on the significant cost of living support already provided to eligible households throughout 2022 – now worth an average of £3,300 per household over this year and last.

Those entitled do not need to do apply for the payment or do anything to receive it. Payments made during this window will be staggered over the next couple of weeks meaning not everyone entitled to receive a payment will receive it today.

Mel Stride, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, said:


  This latest additional payment will be welcomed by millions of families – as will further payments due over the next year.



  We have continually supported those most vulnerable to rising costs, including through record benefits and national living wage increases as well as these exceptional Cost of Living Payments responding to the global pressures we are facing.



  We will also continue to deliver on our five priorities, including halving inflation, as this will ease pressure on households currently struggling with household bills and rising prices.


Jeremy Hunt, Chancellor of the Exchequer, added:


  The best thing we can do to help people’s money go further is deliver on our priorities to halve inflation and grow the economy.



  But we’re also here to help people through these tough times, which is why we’re holding down energy bills, freezing fuel duty, increasing Universal Credit, and giving £900 payments to low income and vulnerable families - all in part funded through windfall taxes on energy profits.


People will be eligible for the Cost of Living Payment if they have been entitled to a payment for one of seven benefits between 26 January and 25 February 2023. The eligible benefits are:

Universal Credit;
  Pension Credit;
  Income-based Jobseekers Allowance;
  Income-related Employment and Support Allowance;
  Income Support;
  Working Tax Credit;
  Child Tax Credit.
Once the majority of those who are entitled to a payment by DWP have been paid, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will make payments of £301 between Tuesday 2 and Tuesday 9 May to one million eligible families receiving tax credits only, with the banking reference ‘HMRC COLS’.

The latest payment follows on from the £650 Cost of Living Payment delivered by the Government in 2022, along with another £150 disability payment and a £300 pensioner payment.

While payments are made automatically, people must be receiving one of the eligible qualifying benefits during the specified period to qualify. Those who wish to check their entitlement to benefits should use a benefits calculator on Gov.uk to get a better idea of what they could receive.

Low-income pensioners particularly should check their eligibility for Pension Credit, as they may still be able to receive the £301 Cost of Living Payment, and subsequent payments, if they make a successful backdated application by 19 May 2023.

Those in need are also encouraged to contact their local council to see if any additional support is available in their local area, such as through the DWP’s Household Support Fund in England, worth over £2 billion across its lifetime.

"19",2023-04-25,"The study aims to learn about antimicrobial resistance in healthy people to inform better ways of tackling antimicrobial resistant infections in different populations.","
    
          The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has launched surveillance to assess the extent of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in healthy people across the country.

Up to 2,000 people will be invited to submit stool samples and nose and throat swabs for the study, which will help scientists understand more about the factors influencing bacteria in our body. By understanding more about the drivers of AMR in the community, we will better be able to design ways to reduce antimicrobial resistant infections.

A large part of AMR understanding is based on bloodstream infections in hospitalised patients – infections at the most severe end of the spectrum. However, everyone has bacteria in their bodies and some of these bacteria may be antibiotic resistant. Often these bacteria won’t cause any harm, unless they get into a part of the body they shouldn’t be – like the urinary tract or lungs, or if they spread to other people.

Through the surveillance study, UKHSA scientists seek to understand more about the levels of antibiotic resistant bacteria found in the general population, including carbapenem-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBLs), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) amongst others, in humans across England.

The study will also explore the prevalence of the fungus Candida auris in the community. The surveillance will also enable UKHSA to compare the change in prevalence of AMR in the population compared to a previous study in 2014 focused on ESBLs.

The work builds on UKHSA’s extensive AMR surveillance programme and aims to further the understanding of how AMR impacts different segments of society, to enable the design of better ways to tackle AMR, tailored to different populations if needed.

The study will look at age, sex, ethnicity, and geographical location to understand if there are any key differences between different demographics. It will also consider different risk factors for AMR, including:

travel
  diet
  healthcare contact
  household transmission
Dr Russell Hope, Deputy Director, AMR Division at UKHSA, said:


  Antibiotic resistant bacteria can cause very severe and difficult to treat infections – killing thousands of people every year in this country and globally, as well as having a huge economic impact. However, very little is known about how commonly antibiotic resistant bacteria are found in the general ‘healthy’ population – mixed in with the ‘good’ and ‘bad’ bacteria that live in our guts.

  By understanding more about the burden of AMR in healthy people in the general population and the factors that mean someone is more likely to be carrying a resistant organism, we will be able to design better ways to tackle AMR in different populations.

  We can all take action to reduce antibiotic resistance. Please trust your healthcare professional and take antibiotics only as prescribed, never share with others and don’t save for later. Taking antibiotics when you don’t need them puts you and your loved ones at risk of having an untreatable infection in future.

  Antibiotic resistance occurs naturally, but inappropriate usage and overuse of antibiotics can accelerate this process. Antibiotic resistant bacteria are less likely to respond to treatment, causing serious complications, including bloodstream infections, sepsis and hospitalisation, so it is important to take antibiotics only when they are prescribed and necessary for the condition.


Health Minister Maria Caulfield said:


  AMR is a silent killer that costs over a million lives across the world per year.

  The UK is a global leader in tackling this threat and we launched a vital Call for Evidence last year to help us shape our next 5-year National Action Plan on AMR.

  This new study will build the evidence base so we can better understand what causes AMR to help us ramp up our efforts to tackle this deadly issue.

Active Travel England (ATE) has welcomed new figures released today from Sport England’s Active Lives survey, which show that 33% of adults took part in active travel at least twice in November 2022.

The survey, which engaged just under 180,000 people and used data from all England local authorities, has revealed that activity levels have returned to pre-pandemic levels, with more adults active in England in 2022 than in the previous year and travel habits seeing the biggest change of all.

In total, 3.2 million more people regularly used active travel in England in the year up to November 2022 than they did in the previous 12 months, with walking and cycling as a form of transport now accounting for around 20% of all minutes of activity taken by adults in England. This is the largest increase in any activity in a given year.

Sport England’s Activity Check-In survey, published in February 2023, has also found that 1 in 5 adults are now walking or cycling rather than using the car due to cost of living increases. This is a smaller survey of 2,000 adults and 450 children and young people that tracks attitudes and opinions at semi-regular intervals during the year.

Sport England Chair and National Active Travel Commissioner, Chris Boardman, said:


  It’s fantastic that more people are choosing to walk, wheel or ride for everyday trips. Just a few minutes of activity every day can make a huge difference to people’s physical and mental health and, of course, it’s free transport, so it’s saving them money too.

  Active Travel England is supporting this increasing appetite for walking, wheeling and cycling by working alongside councils to deliver high-quality routes and crossings to high streets, schools and workplaces. More and more people are joining the movement for moving and we’re here to help put the joy back into their journeys.

          Over five million £25 Cold Weather Payments have been made to households in England and Wales
  Almost two million payments made to pensioners and over three million to working-age households
  Cold Weather Payments are paid directly into people’s bank accounts between November and March
The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) estimates that over £130 million was paid out from November until the end of March – with over £40 million of this going to pensioners in receipt of Pension Credit.

DWP’s Cold Weather Payments are an automatic bank top-up of £25, triggered to be paid to eligible households when the average temperature has been recorded as, or is forecast to be, zero degrees Celsius or below for seven consecutive days at the weather station linked to an eligible person’s postcode.

Around 80% of this winter’s payments – approximately four million – were triggered in December.

Minister for Pensions Laura Trott said:


  Cold Weather Payments provide vital support to help people through cold snaps each Winter.



  While those colder months are now thankfully behind us, there will be no let-up in our extensive support for households across the country.



  This government is committed to helping the most vulnerable in our society. We’re delivering the biggest State Pension increase in history and boosting benefits by over 10 percent, while our Energy Price Guarantee will continue to hold down people’s energy bills.


Between 25 April and 17 May, millions of UK households will receive £301 directly from the DWP. This is the first of three payments totalling up to £900 for those eligible and on means-tested benefits, such as Universal Credit or Pension Credit, in 2023/24. This follows the £650 Cost of Living Payment made to over eight million people in 2022. There will also be further payments worth £150 for eligible disabled people and £300 for pensioners due later this year, meaning the most vulnerable can receive up to £1,350 in direct payments.

One million eligible claimant families receiving tax credits, and no other means-tested benefits, will get the first Cost of Living Payment for the 2023 to 2024 tax year from Tuesday 2 May 2023, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has confirmed.

The £301 government payment will be paid automatically into most customers’ bank accounts between Tuesday 2 and Tuesday 9 May 2023 across the United Kingdom. Only eligible families who receive tax credits and no other means-tested benefits will receive the payment from HMRC.

This is the first of three payments totalling up to £900 for those eligible in the 2023 to 2024 tax year.

Chief Secretary to the Treasury, John Glen, said:


  Higher prices make life difficult for everyone, which is why our priority is to halve inflation this year.

  But we are also going further to support those struggling most, with a total package of support worth an average of £3,300 per household this year and next – including up to £900 in direct cash payments starting next month for families receiving tax credits.


Angela MacDonald, HMRC’s Deputy Chief Executive and Second Permanent Secretary, said:


  The £301 Cost of Living Payment will deliver vital financial help to eligible tax credit customers across the UK. Further support will be paid in autumn 2023 and spring 2024 to those entitled to payment.

  HMRC will pay eligible tax credit customers automatically and with no action required from the customer, to make this as simple and helpful as it can possibly be.


The payment will show as ‘HMRC COLS’ in customers’ bank and building society accounts, so that they know the money is cost of living support.

For tax credit-only customers to be eligible for the £301 Cost of Living Payment, they must have received a payment of tax credits in respect of any day in the period 26 January to 25 February 2023, or later be found to have been entitled to a payment for this period.

Eligible customers do not need to apply or contact HMRC to receive the payment.

The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) recently announced that eligible households receiving DWP means-tested benefits will receive their first payment for the 2023 to 2024 tax year between Tuesday 25 April and Wednesday 17 May. This includes tax credit claimants who also receive other income-related benefits from DWP.

The payments are part of a package of wider government support announced to tackle the cost of living in the 2023 to 2024 tax year, including:

a further £300 Cost of Living Payment for eligible families in autumn 2023, with a payment of £299 in spring 2024
  a £150 Disability Cost of Living Payment for eligible disabled people to be paid during summer 2023
  a £300 Pensioner Cost of Living Payment to be paid during winter 2023-24.
This means that the most vulnerable can receive up to £1,350 in direct payments over the coming financial year if eligible.

Including both DWP and HMRC payments, the latest Cost of Living Payment will see more than 8 million households across the UK receive their £301 cash boost by mid-May 2023.

The government is offering help for households. Customers should check GOV.UK to find out what support they could be eligible for.

          Support for Mortgage Interest loan scheme extended to 200,000 additional Universal Credit claimants in efforts to support more households with the cost of living
  They will be able to access help towards mortgage interest on their home or certain home improvements worth up to £200,000 after three months on Universal Credit
  Support will be automatically offered to qualifying claimants after three months on Universal Credit
Previously, claimants would need to have been unemployed for nine months before they could access a Support for Mortgage Interest loan, which helps them cover interest payments for a mortgage, or a home repairs and improvements loan, whilst they seek work.

Today’s reforms, which were announced in the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement, mean claimants will be able to receive the support after just three months of being on Universal Credit, and in another change they now do not have to be unemployed to do so. They will also be able to re-claim the support if they leave Universal Credit but return within six months.

Mims Davies, Minister for Social Mobility, Youth and Progression, said:


  The fear of losing your home when you have fallen on difficult times is incredibly stressful and makes getting back on your feet all the more difficult.



  This increased support is an important lifeline to help provide stability for those who are seeking to find work and move back towards long-term prosperity.


Support for Mortgage Interest loans will now be automatically offered to claimants by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) if they qualify after three months on Universal Credit – they do not need to do anything to receive this offer.

The loans are designed to help claimants with the interest on mortgages or loans for certain home improvements, such as repairs or improvements to keep their home habitable or to adapt them for people with disabilities, whilst they are on Universal Credit. Even if claimants reject the offer of a loan initially, as long as they are still eligible, they can start claiming it at any point.

The loan needs to be repaid when claimants sell their home, though no one will be asked to sell their home in order to repay it. If needed, claimants can contact the DWP about transferring the loan to a new home.

More widely, the Government is projected to have spent £28.5 billion supporting renters in 2022/23, whilst the Affordable Homes Programme, worth £11.5 billion, will deliver more affordable homes across the country, including tens of thousands for social rent.

The Government has also provided over £1.5 billion for Discretionary Housing Payments since 2012, whilst Local Housing Allowance rates were increased above inflation during the pandemic and have been maintained since to provide housing support to Universal Credit claimants.

"25",2023-04-01,"An additional £842 million is available from today (1 April 2023) to help the most vulnerable households across England with essential food and energy costs.","
    
          Department for Work and Pensions’ £842 million Household Support Fund extension comes into effect today
  Extra money given to councils to provide further help to most in need with essential food and energy costs until 31 March 2024
  Vulnerable households and families encouraged to check their council website for details of support available
The funding, allocated by the Department for Work and Pensions to councils in England, will extend the Household Support Fund for another year.

Councils in England will decide how best to spend their allocation of the fund – now worth £2 billion across its lifetime – by drawing from local knowledge and making direct contact with people in the community.

They will be able to support the most vulnerable households in their local area – helping them with the cost of essentials like groceries, toiletries, and warm clothes, as well as providing further support with energy bills.

People can find out how much their area was awarded at gov.uk and are advised to check their council’s website or call their office to find out what support is available locally to them through the Household Support Fund.

Mims Davies MP, DWP Minister for Social Mobility, Youth and Progression, said:


  This significant extension to the Government’s Household Support Fund is hugely welcome – as it has already helped millions of vulnerable families across England through these financially-testing times and will continue to do so over the next year.



  Last week, I visited one council that is using their allocation to well on a range of issues from food insecurity to tackling bed poverty.



  There, the Household Support Fund has resulted in hundreds of cots and beds being provided to vulnerable households to increase comfort and wellbeing.



  This is just one example of the important locally led schemes providing tailored support help to those that need it most in challenging times.



  This fund is of course just one part of our extensive Cost of Living support package for families that is complementing our efforts to halve inflation – one of the Prime Minister’s top priorities - to reduce prices for us all.


Devolved administrations have also been allocated funding in parallel as a result of the Barnett Formula to spend at their discretion, bringing the total amount of new funding to almost £1 billion.

"26",2023-03-29,"The CMA is launching a new phase of its successful ‘Online Rip-Off Tip-Off’ campaign, which this year is urging consumers to report online rip-offs via a new digital reporting form.","
    
          

Consumer Champion Angellica Bell fronts campaign to call out online rip-offs
  CMA publishes letter to UK businesses detailing its ‘red lines’ when using price reduction and urgency claims
  New poll reveals two thirds (67%) of UK consumers say the impact of cost of living makes them more desperate to find a deal


The campaign, fronted by consumer champion and Martin Lewis Money Show co-presenter Angellica Bell, aims to crack down on practices that could break the law and urges shoppers to call out online rip-offs. 

The campaign seeks to enable consumers to spot and avoid misleading online sales tactics, and to report businesses which engage in misleading tactics. These include: pressure selling, hidden charges, subscription traps and fake reviews. These tactics are designed to mislead and push people to part with their cash online.

Tackling the problem from both angles, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is also publishing today a letter to UK businesses detailing its ‘online red lines’ on misleading price reduction and urgency claims – which are a type of pressure selling. It provides practical illustrations of where common online tactics may be misleading consumers or applying unfair pressure. The advice is for all businesses that sell or promote products online to UK shoppers, so they can stop sales practices that could break the law.

The announcement comes as a survey of 3,700 UK adults* shows that 67% say the cost-of-living pressures have made them more desperate to find the best deals, while 71% believe they are ‘saving money’ by purchasing deals that are on offer – some of which may not be genuine.

The poll also found:

1 in 4 (24%) of UK consumers said they had fallen victim to sneaky online sales tactics
  23% didn’t realise tactics such as ‘15 mins left of sale’ or ‘buy now’ can sometimes be false or misleading
  68% thought these types of misleading tactics should be banned
Angellica Bell, consumer champion and co-presenter of The Martin Lewis Money Show, who is supporting the campaign, said:


  We know that the rising cost-of-living is putting a strain on shoppers across the UK. Some online businesses are using sneaky sales tactics to make us part with our money when household budgets are already stretched. We all feel the pressure of securing bargains, making us more susceptible to being ripped off. It’s frustrating when this happens and it’s time we call out these online retailers and report them to the CMA.


George Lusty, Senior Director for Consumer Protection at the Competition and Markets Authority, commented:


  Now more than ever, every penny counts and the CMA is concerned that some businesses are using underhand tactics designed to part shoppers from their cash.  This poll is just the tip of the iceberg as we believe the true number of victims of these rip-offs is much higher as they are often extremely difficult to spot.

  That’s why businesses using urgency and price reduction claims need to consult the CMA’s new advice. It outlines what businesses need to do when designing their online shopping experiences to be sure they comply with the law.


Notes to Editors


    A description of the online practices referenced in the online red lines advice are:

    Urgency claims: Any scarcity, popularity, ‘act fast’ or time limited claim (including a countdown clock) that is presented to consumers online.  For example, ‘Only 7 left’, ‘14 sold in the last 24 hours’, ‘Hurry! Today only’, ‘Offer ends in 02:50:56’
      Price reduction claims: Any discount or special offer price that refers to a higher comparison price. For example, ‘£32 £16’, or ‘Was 45. Now £20’.
    
  
    A description of the misleading online practices referenced in the Online Rip-Off Tip-Off campaign are:

    Pressure selling: a sales tactic used to give a misleading impression of the limited availability, popularity or usual selling price of a product or service
      Hidden charges: unexpected compulsory fees, charges or taxes being added when someone tries to make an online purchase
      Subscription traps: misleading a customer into signing up to, and paying for, an unwanted subscription that can be difficult to cancel
      Fake or misleading reviews: Reviews which do not reflect an actual customer’s genuine opinion or experience of a product or service.

"27",2023-03-27,"Millions of UK households will receive £301 directly from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) between 25 April and 17 May.","
    
          This is the first of three payments totalling up to £900 for those eligible and on means-tested benefits, such as Universal Credit or Pension Credit, in 2023/24. This follows the £650 Cost of Living Payment made to over eight million people in 2022.

There will also be further payments worth £150 for eligible disabled people and £300 for pensioners due later this year, meaning the most vulnerable can receive up to £1,350 in direct payments.

The £301 payment will be sent out automatically and directly to recipients, meaning those eligible do not need to apply or do anything to receive it. The payment reference for bank accounts will be DWP COLP, along with the claimant’s National Insurance number.

Mel Stride, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, said:


  These payments will give a financial boost to more than eight million households as we continue to wrap our arms around the most vulnerable,  while the best way we can protect people from high costs is to halve inflation by the end of this year.

  In the long-term, we know work is the best route out of poverty, which is why we recently announced additional Work Coach support to help more people find work or increase their hours. Anyone looking to boost their skills or progress their career should speak to their work coach to ensure they’re accessing all the support the DWP can provide.


Jeremy Hunt, Chancellor of the Exchequer, added:


  I know that times are tough, which is why a key focus of the Spring Budget was supporting people with the cost of living and helping people into well-paid work.

  Not only are we providing £900 in direct cash payments to millions of the most vulnerable households, we’ve also extended the Energy Price Guarantee to hold bills down until energy prices fall, raised the National Living Wage to £10.42, put an end to the prepayment meter premium and delivered a plan that will more than halve inflation this year – ensuring everyone’s incomes go further.


The full list of benefit recipients that qualify for the upcoming Cost of Living payment are those who receive:

Universal Credit;
  Income-based Jobseekers Allowance;
  Income-related Employment and Support Allowance;
  Income Support;
  Working Tax Credit;
  Child Tax Credit;
  Pension Credit
The qualifying period for this payment is between 26 January and 25 February 2023.

To be eligible for the Cost of Living Payment, you need to have been entitled to a payment for one of these benefits between 26 January and 25 February 2023, or payment for an assessment period ending between these dates.

DWP is also encouraging low-income pensioners not already getting Pension Credit to check their eligibility, as they can still qualify for the £301 Cost of Living Payment if they make a successful backdated Pension Credit application by 19 May.

Low-income households are also encouraged to contact their local council to see what support is available for essential food and energy costs through the Household Support Fund. Worth over £2 billion across its lifetime, the DWP fund is delivered through councils who are best placed to identify local need.

Those who are eligible for the £301 Cost of Living Payment solely through tax credits, and are not eligible through DWP means-tested benefits, will be paid by HMRC shortly after DWP payments begin. HMRC will publish specific details of when payments will be made to these customers along with the bank account payment reference.

Eligible customers will not need to apply or contact the Government at any stage to receive the £301 Cost of Living Payment.

Notes to Editors

These payments will all be tax-free, will not count towards the benefit cap, and will not have any impact on existing benefit awards.
  The three means-tested cost of living payments, worth up to £900 in total, will be delivered in three slightly different amounts, each relating to a specific qualifying period before the payment is made. This allows DWP and HMRC to ensure support is targeted at those who need it and are eligible; to determine if a payee received the correct payments and identify the payment value; and to reduce the risk of fraud.
  To get the £301 payment someone must (subject to a very limited exception) have been entitled to a payment of a qualifying benefit as follows:
    For Universal Credit, payment for an assessment period ending between the 26 January 2023 to the 25 February 2023
      For all other DWP means-tested benefits, payment in respect of any day between 26 January and 25 February 2023.
      For tax credit-only customers to be eligible they must have received a payment of tax credits in respect of any day in the period 26 January 2023 to 25 February 2023, or later be found to have been entitled to a payment for this period.
      Those on DWP benefits other than Universal Credit who are entitled to less than 10 pence and meet all other qualifying criteria but who do not receive a benefit payment, will still receive a Cost of Living Payment.
    
  More than 6 million people on qualifying disability benefits will receive a Disability Cost of Living Payment of £150 during Summer 2023. This includes those in receipt of one of the following benefits:
  Disability Living Allowance;
  Personal Independence Payment;
  Attendance Allowance;
  Scottish Disability Benefits;
  Armed Forces Independence Payment;
  Constant Attendance Allowance;
  War Pension Mobility Supplement.
  The £300 Pensioner Cost of Living Payment will be paid to all households in receipt of Winter Fuel Payments, in the same way as 2022/23 payments were made.
  Payment windows and eligibility criteria for the remaining Cost of Living payments will be announced in due course.
  For more information on these payments, please visit www.gov.uk/guidance/cost-of-living-payments-2023-to-2024

"28",2023-03-23,"The annual plan details the CMA’s new strategy and priorities for promoting competitive markets and tackling unfair behaviour","
    
          The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has today published its annual plan, setting out its new strategy, priorities for the next three years and areas of focus for 2023/24. The plan details how the CMA will achieve its restated purpose: to help people, businesses, and the UK economy by promoting competitive markets and tackling unfair behaviour.

Under the new leadership of Chief Executive Sarah Cardell and Chair Marcus Bokkerink, the CMA is putting outcomes for people, businesses, and the UK economy at the heart of its strategy. Through its work, the CMA aims to create an environment where:

People can be confident they are getting great choices and fair deals
  Competitive, fair-dealing businesses can innovate and thrive
  The whole UK economy can grow productively and sustainably
The CMA intends to achieve these outcomes by concentrating on a number of medium-term priorities throughout the years ahead. From protecting people from harmful practices and acting in areas of essential spending, particularly for people who need help the most, such as in accommodation; deterring anti-competitive behaviour and enabling innovating businesses to access markets without constraints, such as in digital markets; to enabling UK businesses and consumers to promote sustainability such as through work on green claims and energy efficiency.

The annual plan outlines the CMA’s areas of focus for 2023/24, which include:

Investigating potential competition and consumer protection concerns in the housebuilding and rental sectors
  Addressing pressure selling and false or misleading pricing practices, including through online choice architecture
  Deterring anti-competitive behaviour, including cartels in public procurement, and other areas which have direct effects on public and household expenditure
  Ensuring new and established markets remain open to competitive, innovating businesses, to support the productivity growth and resilience of the UK economy
  Helping to accelerate the UK’s transition to a net zero economy by doing more work on green claims and following up on our call for information in the green heating and insulation sectors, as well as acting in existing and emergent markets for sustainable products and services
CMA Chair Marcus Bokkerink said:


  The CMA exists to help people, businesses, and the UK economy by  promoting competitive markets and tackling unfair behaviour. As people  grapple with the rising cost-of-living and businesses look for ways to innovate  and grow, these imperatives of open, competitive markets and playing by the  rules are more vital than ever. With this plan, we set out our strategic priorities for the years ahead - and place the outcomes we can achieve for people and  businesses in the UK squarely at the centre of everything we do.


CMA Chief Executive Sarah Cardell said:


  I’m very pleased that our new strategy was supported in our conversations with individuals and businesses at engagement events held across the UK. Through our new approach, we are aiming to drive positive change and ensure we can have an even greater impact for people and businesses in the UK.


During the consultation process, the CMA heard from individuals, businesses, charities, trade associations and other regulators on a draft version of the annual plan. The CMA also hosted events with a wide range of stakeholders in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland and met with regional business leaders in Manchester. Overall, the CMA engaged with representatives of around 80 UK-wide stakeholder bodies, as well as its own staff during the consultation period.

For more information, read the annual plan  in full.

"29",2023-03-20,"An extra £22 million is being invested to extend free and impartial support for people making a Universal Credit claim.","
    
          Over three quarters of a million people have already received support though Help to Claim.
  The support, now in its fifth year and delivered by Citizens Advice, provides support to guide people through the Universal Credit claim process.
  
DWP is extending this with a further £22 million of investment to support people to make a new Universal Credit claim.
The ‘Help to Claim’ support will continue to be delivered independently for another year by Citizens Advice and Citizens Advice Scotland, following a further £22 million investment by the department. Citizens Advice have provided the Help to Claim support since its inception in 2019.

This additional investment will ensure that support is available to help people make a new Universal Credit claim and manage their claim until they receive their first payment.

Minister for Employment, Guy Opperman MP, said:


  Help to Claim continues to assist thousands of people every year with over 800,000 people already receiving support since its introduction.



  This additional investment will allow Citizens Advice to continue to provide this vital support following its extension for a further year.



  This high quality and independent support comes in addition to the support already provided through our network of Jobcentres, with our staff standing ready to assist those in need of support.


Dame Clare Moriarty, Chief Executive of Citizens Advice, said:


  As the cost of living continues to put household finances under pressure, our top priority is supporting the many people coming to us for help.



  We’re glad to continue this important support. We’ve seen first-hand the difference our advisers make in helping people access Universal Credit.



  We’ll continue to use our frontline insights and unique data to suggest enhancements to the benefits system, further helping the people we support.


People will be able to access the support and advice online or by telephone. For those who are unable to access support via these channels, individuals will be able to contact their local Jobcentre, where staff will help to identify the right support to meet their needs.

DWP remains committed to providing the best possible support for all claimants, including the most vulnerable in society, in both making and maintaining their Universal Credit claim.

"30",2023-03-16,"A £27 billion tax cut for business and a trio of freezes to help families with the cost-of-living headlined the Chancellor’s Spring Budget ","
    
          
A £27 billion tax cut for business through radical ‘full expensing’ policy and capital allowances reform which will drive investment and growth.
  This government will simplify tax for SMEs with over 340,000 businesses in Scotland set to benefit.
  The broad shoulders of the UK mean that measures to ease cost-of-living burden will help more than halve inflation with the extension of Energy Price Guarantee kept at current level, and duties on fuel and a pub pint both frozen.
  Biggest ever set of reforms to remove the barriers that stop those on benefits, older workers, and those with health conditions who want to work from working.
  The government is launching the refocused Investment Zones programme to catalyse 12 high-potential knowledge-intensive growth clusters across the UK, including four across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
A £27 billion tax cut for business and a trio of freezes to help families with the cost-of-living headlined the Chancellor’s Spring Budget today, Wednesday 15 March.

Aimed at achieving long-term, sustainable economic growth that delivers prosperity with a purpose for the people of the United Kingdom, the Spring Budget breaks down barriers to work, unshackles business investment and tackles labour shortages head on.

Many of today’s decisions on tax and spending apply in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As a result of decisions that do not apply UK-wide, the Scottish Government will receive around an additional £320 million over 2023-24 and 2024-25.

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt said:

“Our plan is working – inflation falling, debt down and a growing economy.

“Britain is on a lasting path to growth with a revolution in childcare support, the biggest ever employment package and the best investment incentives in Europe.”

Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said:

“Today the Chancellor has set out a Budget which continues cost of living support and will deliver sustainable, long-term growth, helping us halve inflation and reduce our national debt.

“Maintaining the Energy Price Guarantee until June will save the average family £160 a year and gives certainty over their bills until summer. We’ve also made changes to Universal Credit to help people get back to work.

“Other UK Government direct investment in Scotland includes £8.6 million for Edinburgh’s world-class festivals, more than £1 million for five new vital community ownership projects, and investment in Scotland’s innovative high tech sector. The Chancellor has also confirmed there will be Investment Zones in all parts of the UK, building on Scotland’s two new Freeports.”

The Chancellor announced the government will pay the childcare costs of parents on Universal Credit moving into work or increasing their hours upfront, rather than in arrears – removing a major barrier to work for those who are on benefits. The maximum they can claim will also be boosted to £951 for one child and £1,630 for two children – an increase of around 50%.

The Chancellor went on to set out plans to continue to support households with cost-of-living pressures including keeping the Energy Price Guarantee at £2,500 for the next three months and ending the premium that over 4 million households pay on their prepayment meter, bringing their charges into line with comparable customers who pay by direct debit. Taken together with all the government’s efforts to help households with higher costs, these measures bring the total support to an average of £3,300 per UK household over 2022-23 and 2023-24.

To help household budgets further, the planned 11 pence rise in fuel duty will be cancelled and the 5p cut will be maintained for another twelve months, saving a typical driver another £100 on top of the £100 saved so far since last year’s cut.

The generosity of Draught Relief has also been significantly extended from 5% to 9.2%, so that the duty on an average draught pint of beer served in a pub both does not increase from August and will be up to 11 pence lower than the duty in supermarkets. The commitment to duty on a pub pint being lower than the supermarket has been termed the “Brexit Pubs Guarantee” by the Chancellor, and will support over 2,500 pubs and bars in Scotland.

The Chancellor also set out a comprehensive plan to remove the barriers to work facing those on benefits, those with health conditions and older workers. An increase in the pensions Annual Allowance from £40,000 to £60,000 and the abolition of the Lifetime Allowance will remove the disincentives to working for longer.

In line with the government’s vision for the UK to be the best place in Europe for companies to locate, invest and grow, a new first-in-Europe ‘full expensing’ policy will be introduced to boost business investment in an effective cut to corporation tax of £9 billion per year. This makes the UK the joint first most competitive capital allowances regime in the OECD and the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast that this will increase business investment by 3% for every year it is in place. Mr Hunt signalled an intention to make this scheme – which covers equipment for factories, computers and other machinery - permanent when responsible to do so.

Accompanying forecasts by the OBR confirm that with the package of measures Mr Hunt set out today, the economy is on track to grow with inflation halved this year and debt falling – meeting all of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s economic priorities. This comes alongside the confirmation that there are no new tax rises within the Spring Budget.

Childcare

Significant reforms to childcare will remove barriers to work for parents receiving Universal Credit not working due to caring responsibilities, reducing discrimination against women and benefitting the wider economy in the process.

Childcare costs of parents moving into work or increasing their hours on Universal Credit paid upfront rather than in arrears, with maximum claim boosted to £951 for one child and £1,630 for two children – an increase of around 50%.
Employment

The Chancellor set out a comprehensive plan to remove the barriers to work facing those on benefits, those with health conditions and older workers.

Experienced workers such as senior doctors will benefit from an increase in the pensions annual allowance from £40,000 to £60,000.
  The Lifetime Allowance will also be abolished altogether, simplifying the tax system through taking thousands out of the complexity of pension tax and stopping over 80% of NHS doctors from receiving a tax charge for any additional hours worked.
  The midlife MOT offer will be expanded and improved to ensure people get the best possible financial, health and career guidance well ahead of retirement. There will be an enhanced digital midlife MOT tool and an expansion of DWP’s in person midlife MOTs for 50+ Universal Credit claimants, aiming to reach 40,000 per year.
  A DWP White Paper on disability benefits reform will herald the biggest change to the welfare system in the past ten years. By abolishing the Work Capability Assessment in Great Britain we will separate level of benefit entitlement from an individual’s ability to work.
  Strengthening work search and work preparation requirements for around 700,000 lead carers of children aged 1-12 claiming Universal Credit in Great Britain.
  Increasing the Administrative Earnings Threshold (AET), which determines how much support and Work Coach time a claimant will receive based on their earnings, for an individual claimant, from 15 to 18 hours at National Living Wage and removing the couples AET in Great Britain. Over 100,000 non-working or low-earning individuals will be asked to meet more regularly Work Coach support to move into work or increase their earnings.
  The application and enforcement of the Universal Credit sanctions regime will be strengthened, by providing additional training for Work Coaches to apply sanctions effectively, including for claimants who do not look for or take up employment, and automating administrative elements of the sanctions process to reduce error rates and free up work coach time.
  Elsewhere, international talent will be attracted through a new migration package that includes adding five construction occupations to the Shortage Occupation List.
Enterprise

The Chancellor put forward a plan to boost innovation, drive business investment and hold down energy costs.

A ‘full expensing’ policy introduced from 1 April 2023 until 31 March 2026 and an extension to the 50% first-year allowance in the same period – a transformation in capital allowances worth £27 billion to businesses over five years.
  A £500 million per year package of support for 20,000 research and development (R&D) intensive businesses through changes to R&D tax credits.
  Generous reforms to tax reliefs for the creative sectors will ensure theatres, orchestras, museums and galleries are protected against ongoing economic pressures and even more world-class productions are made in the UK.
  The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) will receive £10 million extra funding over two years to maximise its use of Brexit freedoms and accelerate patient access to treatments. This will allow, from 2024, the MHRA to introduce new, swift approvals systems, speeding up access to treatments already approved by trusted international partners and ground-breaking technologies such as cancer vaccines and AI therapeutics for mental health.
  All of the recommendations from Sir Patrick Vallance’s review into pro-innovation regulation of digital technologies, published alongside Spring Budget today, are to be accepted.
  £900 million of funding for an AI Research Resource and an exascale computer – making the UK one of only a handful of countries to have one – and a commitment to £2.5 billion ten-year quantum research and innovation programme through the government’s new Quantum Strategy.
Levelling Up

To level up growth across the UK and spread opportunity everywhere, local communities will be empowered to command their economic destiny.

Business rates retention expanded to more areas in the next Parliament.
  Deliver 12 Investment Zones across the UK including 4 across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; support local growth projects in every nation of the UK.
  We will also provide £8.6 million of funding to support the Edinburgh Festivals, and £1 million for 5 community projects in Scotland, including Aberfeldy Sports Club in Perthshire, repairs to the Inveraray Pier, and a community grocery shop and cafe in the Kyle Lochalsh in the Highlands.

  The OBR’s Economic and Fiscal Outlook verifies that the two fiscal rules outlined by the Chancellor at the Autumn Statement – that underlying debt must fall as a percentage of GDP by the fifth year of the forecast and that public sector borrowing must be below 3% of GDP over the same period – are met with buffers of £6.5 billion and £39.2 billion respectively.

"31",2023-03-15,"Millions of households will get more support via the extension of the Energy Price Guarantee to help ease the cost of living, the Chancellor has announced today ahead of the Spring Budget.","
    
          

    The Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) will be kept at £2,500 for an additional three months from April to June, saving a typical household £160.
  
  
    Energy prices are 50% lower than forecast in October, but remain high, with this support helping bridge the gap to lower prices forecast from the end of June.
  
  
    Comes as Chancellor set to confirm new cost of living support at Spring Budget, including ending the prepayment meter premium and help with childcare costs.
  
The Energy Price Guarantee, which is protecting households by capping typical energy bills at £2,500, will be maintained at the same level for a further three months over April, May, and June, worth £160 in total for a typical household.

The Chancellor is announcing the extension today (15 March) as part of his Spring Budget, which focuses on easing the impact of rising prices, delivering on our promise to halve inflation, and growing the economy by supporting more people into work.

Government support has already cut the typical family energy bill by over £1,300 since October, stopping the average household energy bill hitting £4,279 a year this winter.

The Chancellor’s three-month extension of the Energy Price Guarantee at £2,500 means households won’t feel the full force of Ofgem’s Price Cap between April and June – which stands at £3,280 – helping to bridge consumers into the summer.

Lower wholesale gas prices are expected to feed through to lower household energy bills from July, where Cornwall Insight data suggests the Ofgem Price Cap will reach an estimated £2,100 a year for a typical household.

From April, more support is coming online with 8 million low income and vulnerable households set to receive at least £900 in cash payments over the next year, benefits and pensions set to rise by over 10 per cent, and the National Living Wage increasing to a record £10.42 an hour, so that it always pays to work.

The Spring Budget will go even further, providing hundreds of pounds more in help with childcare costs for parents on Universal Credit and ending the energy premium paid by households who use prepayment meters, which will save 4 million families £45 a year from July.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said:


  We know people are worried about their bills rising in April, so to give people some peace of mind, we’re keeping the Energy Price Guarantee at its current level until the summer when gas prices are expected to fall.

  Continuing to hold down energy bills is part of our plan to help hardworking families with the cost of living and halve inflation this year.


Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said:


  High energy bills are one of the biggest worries for families, which is why we’re maintaining the Energy Price Guarantee at its current level. With energy bills set to fall from July onwards, this temporary change will bridge the gap and ease the pressure on families, while also helping to lower inflation too.


Energy Secretary, Grant Shapps said:


  Putin’s illegal war has cost British families, which is why we’ve stepped in to pay around half of the typical household energy bill.

  With wholesale prices falling families will start to benefit, but in the meantime we’re stepping back in with the Energy Price Guarantee to prevent the typical electricity and gas bill exceeding £2,500. It’s just part of our plan to help families this winter.


At Autumn Statement the Chancellor announced that the EPG was due to rise to £3,000 on April 1, with the Government then expecting to borrow £12 billion to fund this support. Since then, energy prices have fallen by 50%, cutting the borrowing needed to fund energy support by two- thirds to £4 billion.

The change announced today also follows the latest Ofgem Price cap of £3,280 from April to June which, in large part, sets the cost for this three-month extension. Households would pay the full Ofgem price cap rate if there was no Energy Price Guarantee.

Holding down energy bills is also part of the government’s plan to halve inflation this year, and in November the Office for Budget Responsibility said that the EPG would lower the peak rate of inflation.

Childcare revolution to expand 30 hours free childcare for children over the age of nine months, alongside boosts to subsidised childcare for parents on Universal Credit including upfront support.
  A £27 billion tax cut for business through radical ‘full expensing’ policy and capital allowances reform which will drive investment and growth.
  Measures to ease cost-of-living burden will help more than halve inflation, with extension of Energy Price Guarantee and duties on fuel and a pub pint both frozen.
  Major set of reforms to support people into work, removing barriers that stop those on benefits, older workers, and those with health conditions who want to work from working.
  Inflation falling, debt down and growth up in Chancellor’s Spring Budget for Growth that delivers upon the Prime Minister’s economic priorities.
Aimed at achieving long-term, sustainable economic growth that delivers prosperity for the people of the United Kingdom, the Spring Budget breaks down barriers to work, unshackles business investment and tackles labour shortages head on.

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt said:

“Our plan is working – inflation falling, debt down and a growing economy.

“Britain is on a lasting path to growth with a revolution in childcare support, the biggest ever employment package and the best investment incentives in Europe.”

The Chancellor announced 30 hours of free childcare for every child over the age of 9 months, with support being phased in until every single eligible working parent of under 5s gets this support by September 2025.

The government will also pay the childcare costs of parents on Universal Credit moving into work or increasing their hours upfront, rather than in arrears – removing a major barrier to work for those who are on benefits. The maximum they can claim will also be boosted to £951 for one child and £1,630 for two children – an increase of around 50%.

The Chancellor went on to set out plans to continue to support households with cost-of-living pressures including keeping the Energy Price Guarantee at £2,500 for the next three months and ending the premium that over 4 million households pay on their prepayment meter, bringing their charges into line with comparable customers who pay by direct debit. Taken together with all the government’s efforts to help households with higher costs, these measures bring the total support to an average of £3,300 per UK household over 2022-23 and 2023-24.

To help household budgets further, the planned 11 pence rise in fuel duty will be cancelled, maintaining last year’s 5p cut for another twelve months,    saving a typical driver another £100 on top of the £100 saved so far since last year’s cut.

The generosity of Draught Relief has also been significantly extended from 5% to 9.2%, so that the duty on an average draught pint of beer served in a pub both does not increase from August and will be up to 11 pence lower than the duty in supermarkets. The commitment to duty on a pub pint being lower than the supermarket has been termed the “Brexit Pubs Guarantee” by the Chancellor, and this change will also be enjoyed by every pub in Northern Ireland thanks to the Windsor Framework.

The Chancellor also set out a comprehensive plan to remove the barriers to work facing those on benefits, those with health conditions and older workers. An increase in the pensions Annual Allowance from £40,000 to £60,000 and the abolition of the Lifetime Allowance will remove the disincentives to working for longer. A new ‘Returnerships’ skills offer for older workers and more stringent Universal Credit job search requirements also feature in the plan that will boost the UK’s workforce, fill vacancies and support economic growth.

In line with the government’s vision for the UK to be the best place in Europe for companies to locate, invest and grow, a new policy of ‘full expensing’ will be introduced for the next three years to boost business investment in an effective cut to corporation tax of £9 billion per year. This makes the UK the joint most competitive capital allowances regime in the OECD and the only major European economy to have such a policy. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast that this will increase business investment by 3% for every year it is in place. Mr Hunt signalled an intention to make this scheme – which covers equipment for factories, computers and other machinery - permanent when responsible to do so.

Accompanying forecasts by the OBR confirm that with the package of measures Mr Hunt set out today, the economy is on track to grow with inflation halved this year and debt falling – meeting all of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s economic priorities. This comes alongside the confirmation that there are no new tax rises within the Spring Budget.

Childcare

Significant reforms to childcare will remove barriers to work for nearly half a million parents with a child under 3 in England not working due to caring responsibilities, reducing discrimination against women and benefitting the wider economy in the process.

30 hours of free childcare for every child over the age of 9 months with working parents by September 2025, where eligibility will match the existing 3-4 year-old 30 hours offer.
  This will be introduced in phases, with 15 hours of free childcare for working parents of 2-year-olds coming into effect in April 2024 and 15 hours of free childcare for working parents of 9 months – 3 years old in September 2024.
  The funding paid to nurseries for the existing free hours offers will also be increased by £204 million from this September rising to £288 million next year.
  Schools and local authorities will be funded to increase the supply of wraparound care, so that parents of school age children can drop their children off between 8am and 6pm – tackling the barriers to working caused by limited availability of wraparound care.
  Childcare costs of parents moving into work or increasing their hours on Universal Credit paid upfront rather than in arrears, with maximum claim boosted to £951 for one child and £1,630 for two children – an increase of around 50%.
  In recognition of both the importance and short supply of childminders, incentive payments of £600 will be piloted from Autumn of this year for those who sign up to the profession (rising to £1,200 for those who join through an agency) to increase the number available and increase choice and affordability for parents.
Employment

The Chancellor set out a comprehensive plan to help people move into work, increase their hours, and extend their working lives, including for those on benefits.

The Lifetime Allowance charge will be removed before being abolished altogether, removing barriers to remaining in work and simplifying the tax system by taking thousands out of the complexity of pension tax.
  The Annual Allowance will be increased from £40,000 to £60,000, incentivising highly-skilled workers to remain in the labour market. As a result of the pensions tax measures announced today, an estimated 80% of NHS doctors will not receive a tax charge with respect to accruals under the 2015 NHS career average scheme.
  A new ‘Returnerships’ apprenticeship targeted at the over 50s will refine existing skills programmes to make them more accessible to older workers, giving them the skills and support they need to find a recognisable path back into work.
  The midlife MOT offer will be expanded and improved to ensure people get the best possible financial, health and career guidance well ahead of retirement. There will be an enhanced digital midlife MOT tool and an expansion of DWP’s in person midlife MOTs for 50+ Universal Credit claimants, aiming to reach 40,000 per year.
  A DWP White Paper on disability benefits reform will herald the biggest change to the welfare system in the past ten years, to make sure it better meets the needs of disabled people in Great Britain. This includes removing the Work Capability Assessment, meaning the majority of claimants will now have to do one health assessment rather than two. Reforms will also support claimants to try work without fear of losing their financial support.
  A new voluntary employment scheme for disabled people and those with health conditions called Universal Support will be funded in England and Wales. The government will spend up to £4,000 per person to find them a suitable role and cater to their needs, supporting 50,000 places per year once fully rolled out.
  A £406 million plan to tackle the leading health causes keeping people out of work, with investment targeted at services for mental health, musculoskeletal conditions, and cardiovascular disease.
  Strengthening work search and work preparation requirements for around 700,000 lead carers of children aged 1-12 claiming Universal Credit in Great Britain.
  Increasing the Administrative Earnings Threshold (AET) - which determines how much support and Work Coach time a claimant will receive based on their earnings - for an individual claimant, from the equivalent of 15 to 18 hours at National Living Wage and removing the couples AET in Great Britain. Over 100,000 non-working or low-earning individuals will be asked to meet more regularly with their Work Coach for support to move into work or increase their earnings.
  The application and enforcement of the Universal Credit sanctions regime will be strengthened, by providing additional training for Work Coaches to apply sanctions effectively, including for claimants who do not look for or take up employment, and automating administrative elements of the sanctions process to reduce error rates and free up Work Coach time.
  Elsewhere, international talent will be attracted through a new migration package that includes adding five construction occupations to the Shortage Occupation List and expanding the range of short-term business activities that are covered under the UK’s six-month business visit visa offer.
Enterprise

The Chancellor put forward a plan to boost innovation, drive business investment and hold down energy costs.

A ‘full expensing’ policy introduced from 1 April 2023 until 31 March 2026 and an extension to the 50% first-year allowance in the same period – a transformation in capital allowances worth £27 billion to businesses over three years.
  A £500 million per year package of support for 20,000 research and development (R&D) intensive businesses through changes to R&D tax credits.
  Generous reforms to tax reliefs for the creative sectors will ensure theatres, orchestras, museums and galleries are protected against ongoing economic pressures and even more world-class productions are made in the UK.
  The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) will receive £10 million extra funding over two years to maximise its use of Brexit freedoms and accelerate patient access to treatments. This will allow, from 2024, the MHRA to introduce new, swift approvals systems, speeding up access to treatments already approved by trusted international partners and ground-breaking technologies such as cancer vaccines and AI therapeutics for mental health.
  All of the recommendations from Sir Patrick Vallance’s review into pro-innovation regulation of digital technologies, published alongside Spring Budget today, are to be accepted.
  £900 million of funding for an AI Research Resource and an exascale computer – making the UK one of only a handful of countries to have one – and a commitment to £2.5 billion ten-year quantum research and innovation programme through the government’s new Quantum Strategy.
Levelling Up

To level up growth across the UK and spread opportunity everywhere, local communities will be empowered to command their economic destiny.

Greater responsibility for local leaders to grow their local economy.
  Over £200 million for high quality local regeneration projects in areas of need, from the transformation of Ashington Town Centre to a skills and education campus in Blackburn.
  Over £400 million for new Levelling Up Partnerships for twenty areas in England most in need of levelling up, such as Rochdale and Mansfield.
  Business rates retention expanded to more areas in the next Parliament.
  Delivering trailblazer devolution deals for the West Midlands and Greater Manchester Combined Authorities that include single multi-year settlements for the next Spending Review, alongside a commitment to negotiate further devolution deals in England.
  12 Investment Zones across the UK including 4 across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
  £8.8 billion over the next five-year funding period for a second round of the City Region Sustainable Transport Settlements.
Many of today’s decisions on tax and spending apply in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As a result of decisions that do not apply UK-wide, the Scottish Government will receive around an additional £320 million over 2023-24 and 2024-25, the Welsh Government will receive £180 million, and the Northern Ireland Executive will receive £130 million.

"33",2023-03-14,"CMA investigation finds Asda’s purchase of 132 petrol stations and attached grocery stores from the Co-op could mean higher prices or less choice for  motorists or shoppers in 13 areas.","
    
          In January 2023, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) opened a Phase 1 investigation into the completed acquisition by Asda of Arthur Foodstores Limited, a company set up by Co-op to sell its 132 petrol forecourt sites.

The CMA’s investigation focused on a number of local areas in which Asda and the Co-op sites that it acquired compete to provide fuel or groceries to customers. The CMA found that the deal raises competition concerns in 13 locations across the UK, in each of which the merging businesses currently compete for customers and would not face sufficient competition after the merger. The deal could therefore lead to consumers and businesses in these areas facing higher prices or lower quality services when shopping or buying fuel.

Asda told the CMA that competition concerns would not arise in these areas because the merger would enable Asda to bring its low-cost pricing model to more customers. But as the CMA’s investigation in this case focussed on local areas in which the merging businesses currently compete for customers, competition concerns only arise in areas in which Asda is already an important option for customers, who already have access to Asda prices. The CMA found that allowing Asda to acquire more sites in those areas, leaving it facing insufficient competition in future, could therefore risk worse outcomes for customers.

Colin Raftery, CMA Senior Director of Mergers, said:


  Groceries and fuel account for a large part of most household budgets. As living costs continue to rise, it’s particularly important that deals that reduce competition among groceries and fuel suppliers don’t make the situation worse.

  While competition concerns don’t arise in relation to the vast majority of the 132 sites bought by Asda, there’s a risk that customers could face higher prices or worse services in a small number of areas where Asda would face insufficient competition in either groceries or fuel after the deal goes through”.


Asda now has 5 working days to offer legally binding proposals to the CMA to address the competition concerns identified. The CMA would then have a further 5 working days to consider whether these proposals address its concerns, or if the case should be referred to an in-depth, Phase 2 investigation.

Notes to editors


    For more information, please see the Asda/Arthur (Co-op) case page.
  
  
    One of the 13 locations, in Earlston, Scotland, raised competition concerns in relation to the supply of both petrol and groceries. The 10 other petrol stations that raised concerns are in Barnard Castle; Calcutt, Caledonian Road; Gnosall (Station Road); Lauder; Minsterley; Oakdale (Ripon Road),Harrogate; Rochester; Stonehaven (Kirkton Road); and Weycock Cross in Barry. The two further areas that raised concerns in relation to groceries are the Co-op mid-size stores in St Columb Minor (Henver Road), and East Peckham.
  
  
    Asda is controlled by Mr Zuber Issa, Mr Mohsin Issa, and the private equity firm TDR Capital, who together also own EG Group.
  
  
    The transaction completed on 30 October 2022. The CMA served an initial enforcement order on 26 October 2022 under section 72(2) of the Enterprise Act 2002 on Asda, Mr Mohsin Issa, Mr Zuber Issa, TDR Capital, Co-op, and Arthur.

          The grant will help thousands more people get access to early legal help after the government announced £12 million of new grant funding in November 2022.

This new grant will run from July 2023 until March 2025, with a greater emphasis on the provision of at court support and building an evidence base through robust data collection. The Access to Justice Foundation has published details on how to apply.

The funding will be awarded to charities providing advice and support to people with legal problems– helping them to better understand their issues and avoid costly court proceedings. This will help to ensure that for those cases where court or tribunal proceedings are necessary, people have the support they need to navigate the process effectively.

This funding adds to more than £5 million of investment from MOJ in this financial year, including a £1 million cost-of-living grant, to help organisations respond to increasing demand for free legal advice. Specialist guidance is offered in person, by telephone or online, to help deal with problems before they escalate or to support those who need to appear in court.

The current Help Accessing Legal Support grant worth £4.8 million will conclude in June 2023.

The Access to Justice Foundation has now launched the application process to award funding to organisations that will directly offer guidance and support.  The closing date for applications is 4pm on Friday 5 May 2023.

"35",2023-03-10,"The Government Office for Technology Transfer (GOTT) has funded the National Physical Laboratory’s development of new ultrasound technology in breast cancer diagnosis.","
    
          
Background

Women with ‘significantly denser’ breast tissue are around 6 times more likely to develop breast cancer than those with ‘low breast density’. Breast density is currently estimated from mammogram and MRI scans, which leaves detection open to clinical judgement and therefore potential room for error.

The knowledge asset solution

The National Physical Laboratory (NPL) is developing innovative new ultrasound technology which provides quantitative measurements of breast tissue composition and has the potential to make a significant impact in breast density assessment. The technology can also help with breast cancer diagnosis and monitoring the response to treatment.

Who will this help?

Patients: Over 700,000 women in the UK are living with undetected high breast density
  Clinicians: Supporting doctors to identify women with high breast density with safe, consistent and reliable technology available outside of a hospital setting
  NHS: Earlier detection of  breast cancer can reduce the cost of treatment and save lives
Funding awards

NPL were awarded £93,954 in the ‘Expand’ phase of the Knowledge Asset Grant Fund (KAGF) in November 2021 and were awarded an additional £199,312 in September 2022 in the ‘Extend’ phase to further develop this technology.


GOTT’s role

GOTT immediately saw the potential for the further development of this public sector owned knowledge asset, and its potential benefits to patients and the healthcare sector. The evidence presented by NPL was strong and an excellent example of how the KAGF can be used to support government bodies to exploit and leverage their knowledge assets and, in this case, improve the diagnosis of cancer.

Quote from NPL


Daniel Sarno, a research scientist at the National Physical Laboratory and a member of the NHS Clinical Entrepreneur Programme, said:


  While the technology is currently in the research phase, we are encouraged by our in-person results and excited for the technology journey from bench top to bedside. The Knowledge Assets Grant Fund has enabled us to continue to pursue our vision for getting this technology into the market and used by those who can benefit from it.

"36",2023-03-09,"UKHSA, ONS and the University of Oxford are thanking over 500,000 people from across the UK for their contribution to the COVID-19 Infection Survey.","
    
          Set up in April 2020, the COVID-19 Infection Survey (CIS) regularly gathered and analysed more than 11 million swab tests and 3 million blood tests from households.

The results have helped to provide vital weekly data on virus positivity levels across the UK, details on new variants, the characteristics of those who had the virus and their antibody levels and details of long COVID prevalence. This helped develop an understanding of COVID-19 and inform government decision-making throughout the pandemic.

The widespread rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine programme, together with improved treatments for the most vulnerable, has enabled the transition to living with COVID-19. This means the approach to COVID-19 surveillance is being actively reviewed by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) to ensure it is proportionate, cost effective and considered alongside how we monitor a range of other infectious diseases that present a similar risk to the public’s health.

UKHSA will confirm details of any new surveillance surveys that continue beyond 31 March 2023 in due course. In the meantime, data collection for the COVID-19 Infection Survey will be paused.

Professor Steven Riley, Director General of Data, Analytics and Surveillance at UKHSA, said:


  The COVID-19 Infection Survey has been an important tool in helping us understand COVID-19 and we’d like to thank every single participant for the huge contribution they have made.

  We will continue to ensure our surveillance activities remain proportionate and cost effective with the move to Living with COVID-19. Participants of the COVID-19 Infection Survey will be uniquely placed to support future surveillance activities and we and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) very much look forward to working with them in the future.

  We remain committed to monitoring the threat posed by COVID-19 through our range of surveillance systems and genomics capabilities, which report on infection rates, hospitalisations and the risks posed by new variants.


Sir Ian Diamond, National Statistician and Chief Executive of the ONS, said:


  The pandemic has been a formidable test of our ability to gather and analyse data quickly, and the unique value of the COVID-19 Infection Survey has been recognised worldwide.

  The data from this survey has had an incredible impact on the country’s response to the pandemic, and its success instils confidence in the ability to stand up wider surveillance activities in future.

  As UKHSA works to confirm its approach to COVID-19 surveillance, we plan to continue gathering valuable insight into the experiences of COVID-19 and other respiratory infections and long COVID in communities, and looking forward to continuing to work with CIS participants to do so.


Professor Sarah Walker, Chief Investigator of the survey and Professor of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology at the University of Oxford, said:


  The COVID-19 Infection Survey is an extraordinary achievement, the successes of which have been driven by the selfless contribution of hundreds of thousands of people taking part across all 4 nations of the UK, as well as of several thousand study workers originally delivering home visits throughout lockdowns.

  The data collected will continue to be valuable for many years to learn more about how COVID-19 infection and vaccination affect future health outcomes.


UKHSA continues to publish regular reports on COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, including through our weekly surveillance reports, which provide data on infection rates, hospitalisation numbers and vaccination uptake. We also maintain the ability to track the latest variants through our genomics capabilities, which assess the risks posed by different strains of the virus.

"37",2023-03-07,"The most vulnerable will be better supported to access justice despite the rising cost of living thanks to new proposals published today (7 March) to reform the government ‘Help with Fees’ scheme.","
    
          

new proposals to help people pay court and tribunal fees
  plans include raising income threshold for ‘Help with Fees’ scheme
  intervention will support vulnerable families through rising cost of living


The scheme supports people on low incomes and with little to no savings with court and tribunal fees, ensuring a person’s financial situation does not limit their ability to seek justice.

The government has launched a 12-week consultation to expand the scheme by raising the income threshold for eligibility and providing better targeted support for those on lower incomes.

In the last year alone, the scheme provided over £80 million in financial help for thousands of people so they can exercise their legal rights in a wide range of cases such as family disputes, housing issues and compensation claims for personal injury.

Today’s move could potentially help thousands more people with the costs associated with their court and tribunal fees.

Justice Minister, Mike Freer, said:


  We recognise this is a challenging time financially for people across the country so it is vital we continue to ensure everyone can afford justice.

  The Help with Fees scheme has helped thousands of vulnerable people to pay court fees since its inception in 2013 and our reforms will make the scheme more generous and targeted at those who need it most.


Proposed changes to income thresholds will vary depending on different families and their circumstances, including the age of any children. For example:

For a couple with 2 children under 14, the monthly income threshold would increase from £1,875 per month to £2,980.
  For a single person with no children the threshold would increase from, £1,170 per month to £1,420.
For the first time eligibility for the scheme will also take into account the extra costs associated with looking after a child aged over 14, making sure families in these circumstances benefit from more generous support towards the costs of court and tribunal fees.

To make sure the most financially vulnerable are better supported, the government also plans to change how the scheme is targeted by:

Providing more flexibility for individuals with money in savings and investments by increasing the minimum capital threshold for the scheme. This will allow applicants to have more capital before they become ineligible for the scheme.
  Making it easier for the self-employment and those who work variable shift patterns to qualify as the revised scheme better recognises that income can fluctuate month- on-month.
  Ensuring those on higher incomes contribute more towards their court and tribunal fees, by revising partial fee discounts so the more an individual earns, the more they pay towards their fees.
  Raising the scheme’s age cap to the state pension age of 66 from 61.
To qualify for the scheme an individual needs to be on a low income or be on benefits such as Income Support, Universal Credit or Pension Credit.

Some people on a higher income may still be supported by the scheme. Individuals can check their eligibility and apply for the scheme online.

Notes to editors

Help with Fees is the single fee remission scheme applicable to all courts and tribunals in England and Wales, the UK Supreme Court and to tribunals with a UK-wide jurisdiction.

Dormant Assets Scheme redirects money from forgotten accounts to good causes
  £76 million will go to those struggling with the cost of living, including through no-interest loans
  In England, Scheme is being expanded to include community wealth funds, pots of money that will allow local residents to improve their communities
The most vulnerable people in society will be given additional support to deal with the cost of living, as £76 million tied up in forgotten accounts is unlocked.

The cash will support people to get out of debt and assist social enterprises with innovative energy saving solutions.

Beneficiaries include no-interest loans for 69,000 individuals struggling with finances via a £45 million grant distributed by Fair4All Finance, and hundreds of charities and social enterprises which will receive support from a pot of £31 million, distributed by social investors Access and Big Society Capital. This will be used to retrofit premises with cleaner, greener, and more efficient energy systems, such as new boilers or heat pumps, solar panels, and new lighting.

Dormant assets are financial assets left untouched for long periods. Led by the financial services industry and backed by the government, the Dormant Assets Scheme aims to reunite people with these lost funds. Where this is not possible, it can be transferred to the Dormant Assets Scheme to be distributed to important social and environmental initiatives.

The Dormant Assets Scheme unlocks money from forgotten bank and building society accounts, and will soon include further assets from the insurance and pensions, investment and wealth management, and the securities sectors.

An estimated £738 million more will be made available over time thanks to the expansion of the Scheme to the new sectors.

Since 2011, £892 million has been released via the Scheme. In England, dormant assets money has been used to support young people, help those in financial difficulty, and generate social investment.

The government is also today announcing that community wealth funds will become an additional beneficiary of the Dormant Assets Scheme. A community wealth fund is a pot of money distributed to communities in deprived areas and released over a long time period, with local residents empowered to make decisions on how to use the money.

To ensure that local decision-making sits at the heart of a community wealth fund, the government will shortly launch a public consultation to gather public and industry views on the overarching design of this important new initiative.

Youth, social enterprises, and people in financial difficulty will continue to be supported, with previous beneficiaries including community centres and charities providing care for the socially isolated and elderly.

Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer said:


  Today we are announcing that millions of pounds will be redirected from dormant accounts to help the most vulnerable in society deal with the cost of living.

  This will have a real impact on people’s lives, help alleviate debt and provide money saving solutions for charitable organisations.


DCMS Minister Stuart Andrew said:


  The public consultation on dormant assets funding provided people with the opportunity to name how money that will be unlocked should be spent, and I’m delighted to announce our plans to introduce a community wealth fund as a new cause.

  The creation of a community wealth fund will give local residents in some of the more deprived areas of the country the power to improve where they live and invest in what’s important to them.


David Knott, Chief Executive, The National Lottery Community Fund said:


  As the distributor of dormant assets, The National Lottery Community Fund sees first-hand the life changing difference this funding makes. I welcome the Government’s plans to include community wealth funds alongside existing causes. This reflects The National Lottery Community Fund’s experience of funding and supporting communities over decades. I look forward to turbo charging efforts through this expansion.


Jane Hanson, CBE, Chair, Reclaim Fund Ltd and Dormant Assets Expansion Board  said:


  The Government’s announcement on future dormant assets funding comes at a particularly important time given the pressures on so many households. Thanks to the collaborative efforts of the Dormant Assets Expansion Board, which brings together industry, government and regulators, the Scheme is now poised for expansion, which could result in £880 million in additional dormant assets funding to good causes across the UK. Reclaim Fund Ltd is making the final preparations to launch the expanded Scheme and we look forward to welcoming participants from the insurance and pensions sector, followed by other sectors, including investment and wealth management, later this year.


Kirsty Cooper, Champion for the Insurance and Pensions sector and Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, Aviva said:


  I’m delighted with the Government’s new announcement on future dormant assets funding. The expanded Scheme will help to make a real difference to the lives of those people who need it most across society, freeing up millions of pounds at a time when financial hardship is a real cause for concern, and I welcome the news that financial inclusion will receive additional funding to support this.


Reclaim Fund Ltd is making the final preparations to launch the expanded Scheme. This will welcome the first participants from the insurance and pensions sector in the coming months, with other sectors joining later this year.

The Dormant Assets Scheme has supported many projects across the country already. These include:

Following the pandemic, Chanctonbury Community Leisure in Storrington, West Sussex were provided with a £50,000 grant and £100,000 loan from CAF Venturesome which was partly used to install a new 3G pitch. This has become a major community asset with 20 local teams training each week on the facility, including a new girls’ football team and women’s football and rugby teams.
  Supported by Big Society Capital, The Greater Manchester Homes Partnership have enabled 355 of Greater Manchester’s homeless people to be housed.
  Youth Futures Foundation has supported 802 young people in the Greater Manchester region with employability skills, including through the Manchester Deaf Centre, which helps children and young people who are deaf, deaf/blind, or children of deaf adults and have experienced increased isolation due to Covid-19.
  Fair4All Finance has committed £25 million to the Affordable Credit Scale Up Programme, which is projected to help triple the availability of affordable credit to approximately £900 million by 2025.
  Big Society Capital committed £8.5 million to Black Country Reinvestment Society, which invests in local enterprises, such as Miss Macaroon, a social enterprise which reinvests 100% of its profits into helping unemployed young people gain employability skills.
  Access’s Growth Fund supported 41 projects across the Liverpool City Region with £3.7 million investment. This includes support for Homebaked, a co-operative bakery and community land trust based opposite Liverpool FC’s Anfield stadium, enabling them to meet growing demand through the development of a dedicated catering unit with specialised equipment and freeing up space in their own kitchens for classes for local children.

Notes to editors

A dormant asset is a financial product, such as a bank account, that the customer has not used for many years, and which the business has been unable to reunite them with, despite making efforts based on industry best practice.
  Dormant assets remain the property of their owners and the Scheme must match what the business would have paid the owner had their assets never been transferred into the Scheme. This means that owners can reclaim any money owed to them at any time.
  Under the Scheme, funds are held by Reclaim Fund Ltd (RFL). RFL is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, and holds sufficient money to cover any reclaims while distributing the surplus to The National Lottery Community Fund for social or environmental initiatives across the UK.
  The Scheme is dependent on the voluntary participation of businesses, who can choose to transfer money from the dormant assets they hold to Reclaim Fund Ltd.
  In 2022 it was announced that the Scheme would be expanded to include dormant assets in the insurance and pensions, investment and wealth management, and securities sectors, in addition to dormant bank and building society accounts. This is estimated to unlock a further £880 million over time, £738 million of which will be made available for England.
  Following a public consultation, the government intends to name youth, financial inclusion, social investment wholesalers, and community wealth funds as the four purposes of the English portion.
  The government aims to publish a statement of intent this year to announce the proportions of funding this government intends to allocate to the four causes, provided the Scheme secures sufficient participation. This will be based on an evidence-led analysis of need in the four sectors and where dormant assets funding could make a meaningful impact while remaining additional to Exchequer funding.
  No money can flow to a community wealth fund until this cause has been set in secondary legislation, as current legislation only permits the English portion to be spent on youth, financial inclusion, and social investment wholesalers. Secondary legislation will be laid as soon as the parliamentary timetable allows.
  No decisions have been made on how much funding will be awarded to a community wealth fund, or which organisation(s) will deliver it.
  Dormant assets money in England will continue to be available as funding for youth, financial inclusion, and social investment initiatives. Financial inclusion is defined as the development of individuals’ ability to manage their finances or the improvement of access to personal financial services. The government will explore how financial education and capability can additionally be supported in the future, in line with its broad definition. Alongside the Scheme’s work to increase availability of affordable financial products, this will aim to give people the tools and knowledge they need to better manage their money and understand financial terminology.
  Charities will continue to receive support for their energy bills until March 2024 under the government’s Energy Bills Discount Scheme, with a £18 billion package of energy support having been provided for organisations and businesses throughout this winter.
  This is in addition to wider support to help charities with their costs, including a reduction in VAT from 20% to 5%.
  The government also provided the sector with a £750 million package of Covid support for frontline charities - that supported more than 14,000 charities and reached an estimated 21.5 million people.
  In addition to the Energy Price Guarantee this winter, the government provided £1200 worth of support to the most vulnerable households for 2022-23:
    £650 in cost of living payments;
      £400 through the Energy Bill Support Scheme;
      £150 Council Tax rebate;
      Additional support for pensioners and those claiming disability benefits.
    
  The government has announced further support on the cost of living in 2023-24, targeted at those most in need:
    UK households on means-tested benefits will receive a further £900 Cost of Living Payment;
      Pensioner households across the UK will receive an additional £300 Cost of Living payment;
      People across the UK on non-means-tested disability benefits will receive a further £150 Disability Cost of Living payment, to help with the additional costs they face.
    
  DCMS is backing the country’s powerhouse sectors to grow the economy and make a difference where people live.
  The civil society sector is worth at least £16 billion to the UK economy. There are 951,000 jobs in the sector, over 50,000 more jobs than in 2019 before the pandemic.
Additional supportive quotes

Adrien Smith, OBE, Chief Executive, Reclaim Fund Ltd said:


  Over the past 12 years, thanks to the banks and building societies who participate in the Scheme, RFL has been able to release £892 million to dormant asset spend organisations. Every day, this money transforms lives, through initiatives in financial inclusion, youth and social investment. The Government’s commitment to continued funding in these areas will provide welcome assurance to Scheme participants, many of whom choose to participate as these causes are aligned with their social responsibility priorities.


Economic Secretary to the Treasury Andrew Griffith said:


  I am thrilled that the Dormant Assets Scheme has reached this significant moment, with the expanded Scheme giving a substantial funding boost to financial inclusion. As City Minister, this is a priority, and I was pleased to recently have met with leaders across industry and charities to discuss how we make progress on this issue in the coming year. Today’s announcement is a reminder of the financial services sector’s vital role in combining economic growth with supporting communities in every part of the UK.

          With widespread concerns about housing availability and costs, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has launched a new phase of work in the housing sector. The CMA is launching a market study into housebuilding, and will start a separate consumer protection project related to rented accommodation.

The market study comes following concerns builders are not delivering the homes people need at sufficient scale or speed. The CMA’s consumer protection work will seek to shed light on the experience of renters and explore whether more could be done to help landlords and intermediaries to understand their obligations.

Sarah Cardell, Chief Executive of the CMA, said:


  The quality and cost of housing is one of the biggest issues facing the country. Over the last few years, the CMA delivered real change for leaseholders, with tens of thousands of homeowners receiving refunds after being overcharged unfair ground rents.

  With that work nearly finished, we’re now looking to probe in more detail two further areas – the housebuilding and the rental sectors.

  If there are competition issues holding back housebuilding in Britain then we need to find them. But we also need to be realistic that more competition alone won’t unlock a housebuilding boom.

  In the same vein, we want to explore the experiences people have of the rental sector and whether there are issues here that the CMA can help with.

  We will of course be guided by the evidence, but if we find competition or consumer protection concerns we are prepared to take the steps necessary to address them.


Housebuilding market study

The CMA’s market study into housebuilding will focus on 4 areas:

housing quality: looking at how builders are delivering the right sorts of homes that communities and buyers need – including the fairness of estate management fees charged for ‘unadopted’ roads and amenities
  land management: examining whether the practice of ‘banking’ land before or after receiving planning permission is anti-competitive
  local authority oversight: exploring how councils oversee the delivery of homes and how developers negotiate affordable home requirements
  innovation: considering whether factors may be holding builders back from adopting new building techniques or moving towards more sustainable, net zero homes
A market study allows the CMA to use compulsory information-gathering powers to probe the entire market. As well as helping develop a deeper understanding of how and when housebuilders decide to deliver new homes and the interaction of that with local authority housing targets, the study will consider the issues faced by smaller, regional firms.

thousands of prisoners join drug-free wings as war on addiction ramps up
  up to 100 special blocks in prisons by 2025 alongside abstinence-based units
  new wings and tough security to clean up prisons and cut crime


New Incentivised Substance Free Living Units are now up and running in 45 prisons across England and Wales - getting addicts off illicit drugs and reducing their reliance on synthetic opiates like methadone.

Figures show around half of prisoners are addicted to drugs, while crack and heroin addicts account for two-thirds of shoplifting offences and half of burglaries, blighting communities up and down the country.

Yet offenders who are supported to get off drugs for good are 19 percentage points less likely to slip back into a life of crime.

The new wings will make sure prisons are places where criminals get – and stay – clean while they pay their debt to society, instead of languishing on drug substitutes like methadone which can hinder their rehabilitation.

Today’s news, alongside tough new security including X-ray body scanners, forms a cornerstone of the government’s strategy to break the cycle of addiction and re-offending which costs the tax-payer £19 billion a year.

Deputy Prime Minister, Justice Secretary and Lord Chancellor, Dominic Raab, said:


  We are clamping down on drugs behind bars with tough new security, but we know reducing supply is not enough to break the cycle of addiction and offending.

  Our new drug-free units and drug recovery wings will help prisoners tackle their addictions, including to opiate substitutes like methadone, in turn cutting their risk of reoffending and creating safer streets.


The government is also investing in up to 18 drug recovery wings where prisoners can go through 6 months of intensive abstinence-based treatment to break their reliance on methadone as well as dangerous substances.

On the new incentivised units, offenders will tackle their addictions through substance misuse courses and regular drug testing

In exchange, prisoners who are making progress towards getting clean receive extra time out of cell for education and work opportunities and, once they’ve turned their back on drugs for good, including substitutes like methadone, the prospect of being transferred to a drug recovery wing for 6 months of intensive, fully abstinence-based treatment.

"41",2023-02-09,"New materials published by the CMA remind employers to brush up on competition law and avoid illegal collusion","
    
          The CMA has published new easy-to-read materials, which seek to boost business compliance and remind employers of their legal obligations to avoid collusion when it comes to employee pay, working conditions and the hiring of staff.

Employers across the United Kingdom are required to comply with competition law when setting wages and working conditions for new and existing employees, as well as policies on staff recruitment and retention. This helps ensure successful candidates and existing staff are paid fairly for their work and can opt to move to another employer where pay and conditions are better.

The new materials cover no-poaching agreements, where businesses agree not to hire each other’s employees; wage-fixing agreements, where businesses who compete for the same types of employees fix salaries; and information sharing about the terms and conditions of employees’ contracts.

It includes practical pointers for businesses to comply with the law, such as:

understanding how competition law applies to no-poaching and wage-fixing agreements
  training HR staff on competition law and how it applies to agreements within recruitment
  ensuring internal reporting processes are in place so staff can report no-poaching agreements or wage-fixing
Juliette Enser, CMA Senior Director of Cartels, said:


  When it comes to labour markets, breaking competition law won’t just negatively impact staff and potential recruits – who rightly expect their employers to play by the rules, as they cope with the rising cost of living – but could result in large fines or the disqualification of directors if you are caught.

  Businesses have no excuse for not following the law and ignorance is no defence when it comes to colluding with competitors to rig the labour market in their favour.

  The materials we published today will help ensure all employers understand their responsibilities under competition law and sets out how the CMA will take action against those who engage in anti-competitive behaviours.


Notes to editors


    The new guide for employers on how to avoid breaking competition law was published by the CMA on 09 February 2023.
  
  
    If you’ve witnessed an illegal business cartel or been involved in one, you can do the right thing by reporting it to us: If you’ve seen something: call us on 020 3738 6888 or email cartelshotline@cma.gov.uk. If the information you provide leads to an investigation, you may earn a reward. If you have been involved: tell us and you may get leniency. Call us on 020 3738 6833 and we can provide confidential guidance.
  
  
    Following a CMA investigation, a business found to have breached competition law could be subject to significant financial penalties of up to 10% of their annual worldwide turnover. Individuals participating in illegal collusion can also face significant personal fines, imprisonment and be disqualified from their role.  This disqualification can last up to 15 years, seriously affecting business options.

"42",2023-02-07,"Over 8 million families in the UK will continue to receive direct financial support from Government, with the first of five Cost of Living Payments – worth £301 – hitting bank accounts this spring.","
    
          Over 8 million families in the UK on means-tested benefits will automatically receive £301 this Spring, and over 6.5 million people on disability benefits in the country will receive a £150 payment this summer
  £301 payment is the first of five direct cost of living payments for the most vulnerable households, including pensioners and disabled people, with the total amount of support reaching up to £1,350
  Full breakdown released showing recipients of Cost of Living and disability payments by local authority and parliamentary constituency
After confirming the payment schedule for five cost of living payments through the 2023/24 financial year, The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has today announced in Parliament more detail on the support.

This includes estimates of how many people across the UK, and in each local authority and parliamentary constituency, will receive the first £301 Cost of Living Payment and the £150 Disability Payment, which follows on from up to £1,200 in support for low-income households in 2022.

Work and Pensions Secretary, Mel Stride said:


  These direct payments will help people right across the UK over this year and the start of the next, as we continue to provide consistent, targeted and substantial support for the most vulnerable.

  Our wider support package, including the Energy Price Guarantee, will ensure every household is being helped through this challenging period of high inflation, caused by Putin’s illegal war and the aftershocks of the pandemic.


Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt added:


  High inflation, exacerbated by Putin’s illegal war, is hurting economies across the world and making people poorer.

  These payments are the next part of the significant support we are providing through this challenging time, with millions of vulnerable households receiving £900 directly into their bank accounts this financial year alongside additional help for pensioners and those with disabilities.

  This latest payment will provide some temporary relief, but the best thing we can do to help families and businesses is to stick to the plan to halve inflation this year.


Exact payment windows and qualifying periods for eligibility will be announced in due course, but are designed to ensure a consistent support offer throughout the year. Payment windows will be broadly as follows:

£301 – First 2023/24 Cost of Living Payment – during Spring 2023
  £150 – 2023 Disability Payment – during Summer 2023
  £300 – Second 2023/24 Cost of Living Payment – during Autumn 2023
  £300 – 2023 Pensioner Payment – during Winter 2023/4
  £299 – Third 2023/24 Cost of Living Payment – during Spring 2024
There are several benefits that could make claimants eligible for the £301 Cost of Living Payment, including Universal Credit and tax credits – through which 5.4 million households across the UK are expected to qualify, and Pension Credit, through which 1.4 million pensioner households are expected to be paid. 1.3 million will be eligible through legacy DWP benefits such as Jobseekers Allowance and Income Support, reaching a total of 8.1 million households.

Eligible individuals do not need to apply for payments, as they are made automatically. Those eligible for cost of living payments through tax credits, and no other means-tested benefits, will be paid by HMRC shortly after DWP payments are made.

This builds on the government’s wider support package, which includes further funding for the Household Support Fund, bringing its total value for October 2021 to March 2024 to over £2 billion. The fund is distributed to English councils, who know their areas best and are then able to offer direct support for those most in need in their local area. Every household with a domestic electricity supply is also benefitting from the Energy Price Guarantee, which is saving the average household around £900 this winter and a further £500 in 2023/24 by capping energy costs.

Benefits will also rise in line with inflation from April, which will see a 10.1% increase for pensioners and those on the lowest incomes, whilst the National Living Wage will see its biggest ever cash rise, bringing it to £10.42 an hour.

This all follows on from 2022’s support package, which included:

A £650 Cost of Living Payment for means-tested benefit claimants, split into two payments, each of which supported over eight million households
  Further £300 and £150 payments, which reached over eight million pensioner households and six million disabled people respectively
  A £150 Council Tax rebate for all households in Council Tax bands A to D in England
  A £400 energy bill discount for all households, which will continue to run through March 2023"
"43",2023-02-03,"The CMA found that Portman Healthcare’s anticipated deal to buy Dentex Healthcare raised competition concerns which could harm treatment for patients living in the South West and North East","
    
          An initial investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has found that a merger between 2 dental providers would not harm the majority of patients in the United Kingdom, but action is needed to address specific competition concerns for those living in the South West and North East of England.

The CMA carried out a Phase 1 investigation into the anticipated purchase of Dentex Healthcare Group Limited (Dentex Healthcare) by Portman Healthcare (Group) Limited (Portman Healthcare), which is owned by Core Equity Holdings. The companies would together operate approximately 400 dental practices across the United Kingdom.

The investigation looked at the potential impact of the merger for patients in areas where both businesses currently offer NHS or private dental treatments, which range from general dentistry (for example, check-ups and fillings) to more complex procedures like implants and orthodontics.

While sufficient competition will remain after the merger in most cases, the CMA found that the deal would raise competition concerns in the provision of NHS orthodontic treatments in Truro as well as for private dental services provided to those living in Tavistock, Ashburton and Durham. Additional concerns were also found in relation to competition for NHS contracts to provide orthodontic services across Cornwall and Isles of Scilly, where access to specialist treatment is limited for patients.

Prior to the conclusion of the investigation, the businesses accepted that the merger would raise concerns in these areas and asked the CMA to move straight to a discussion of potential remedies to address these concerns.

Sorcha O’Carroll, CMA Senior Director of Mergers, said:


  Everyone should have access to dental treatment wherever they live in the UK. Competition between dental practices is crucial to ensure patients have access to good quality services at competitive prices. While in the majority of areas the deal will not harm patients, we are concerned that it could lead to less choice, lower quality and higher prices for patients in certain parts of the UK.

  The businesses involved have accepted our concerns and it’s now up to them to address these effectively, so we can prevent a loss of competition in the South West and North East – resolving any need for further investigation.

    More information on the CMA’s fast track procedure can be found in section 7 of Mergers: Guidance on the CMA’s jurisdiction and procedure (PDF, 1.04MB).
  
  
    The CMA is, in most cases, required to issue a Phase 1 decision within 40 working days. Merging parties are required to formally offer proposed remedies (undertakings in lieu of a referral to a Phase 2 investigation (UILs)) within 5 working days after receiving the CMA’s Phase 1 decision and the CMA then decides, within 10 working days after the Phase 1 decision, whether to provisionally accept the UILs offered. The CMA then has 50 working days (subject to an extension of up to 40 working days) to consider whether to finally accept these remedies.
  
  
    The CMA’s concerns within Cornwall and Isles of Scilly, including specifically in Truro, relate to the provision of NHS orthodontic treatments by the parties. The cost of treatments through these appointments is strictly regulated by the NHS – so patients will pay the same if they are able to get treatment.  The CMA’s concerns in Tavistock relate to the private provision of orthodontic and implant treatments; in Durham, the private provision of general dentistry, restorative, periodontics and cosmetics treatments; and in Ashburton, the private provision of implant treatments.

All CMA recommendations to tackle “dysfunctional” children’s social care market accepted
  Department for Education commits to ongoing programme of implementation
  CMA CEO says: “This is a much-needed first step to improving the lives of vulnerable children and young people who rely on these services”
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched a market study into children’s social care in March 2021 due to concerns over a lack of availability of placements and high prices.


The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched a market study into children’s social care in March 2021 due to concerns over a lack of availability of placements and high prices.

Its final report, published in March 2022, found there is a shortage of appropriate places in children’s homes and with foster carers – meaning some children are not getting the right care from their placement. It also found that some children are being placed far away from their hometown or separated from their siblings. This shortage of places has driven up prices, meaning local authorities – who are responsible for placing children in an appropriate home – are paying higher costs, which are then picked up by taxpayers.

The CMA’s study also found that private sector investors appear to be making higher profits in England and Wales than the CMA would expect in a well-functioning and competitive market. This suggests authorities may be paying more for these services than they need to, particularly when it comes to fostering services which are often cheaper when run by local authorities.

To address the issues it found and help make sure children are properly protected, the CMA made a number of recommendations to government – all of which have today been accepted by the Department for Education (DfE) in respect of England.

As part of its wider strategy to improve the sector, the DfE has committed to implement these recommendations to ensure long-term reform, including:

Developing regional bodies to support local authorities in obtaining suitable placements for children: These bodies will be able to engage better with placement providers, such as care homes and foster agencies, to help make sure the right placements are available when and where children need them. They will also be trialled and evaluated to make sure they are fit for purpose.
  Introducing a financial oversight regime: Establish an oversight regime to assess the financial health of care home providers that are most difficult to replace, and alert authorities if a failure is likely.
  Reviewing regulation relating to the placement of children: Create an expert working group to review all existing legislation and regulation regarding children’s social care, and develop a common set of standards for fostering, children’s homes and supported accommodation.
Sarah Cardell, Chief Executive at the CMA, said:


  This is a much-needed first step to improving the lives of vulnerable children and young people who rely on these services. Our recommendations, all of which have been accepted by the Department for Education, will help build a better and more supportive system.

  We’ll continue to work with the government to make sure these proposals deliver longstanding improvements, providing every child in care with the right home.


The CMA’s study looked at children’s social care in England, Scotland, and Wales, across which there are over 100,000 looked-after children. The current annual cost for children’s social care services is around £5.7 billion in England, £680 million in Scotland and £350 million in Wales.

The study highlighted and reflected the significant differences in the policy context for children’s social care between England, Scotland, and Wales. The Scottish Government and the Welsh Government each committed to move away from the model of for-profit provision in children’s social care, and national organisations exist in these nations to support local authorities. The CMA will continue to work with both governments as they move through their own policy reform processes.

For more information, see the Children’s social care study webpage.

Notes to editors

Analysis of prices and profits is from financial data obtained from the 15 largest private providers of children’s social care across all three nations, covering the period since the financial year 2016. Our analysis covers independent providers responsible for around a fifth of placements in children’s homes and slightly over half of fostering placements.
  In England, 72% of children in care are placed in foster care, 13% in residential care such as children’s homes, and 15% in other settings including unregulated accommodation. In Scotland, 33% are in foster care, 10% in residential care and 57% in other settings (the higher percentage in other settings in Scotland reflects a broader definition of care, but excludes unregulated settings, which is not permitted in Scotland). In Wales, 70% of children are in foster care, 7% in residential care, and 23% in other settings.
  The largest proportion of children’s homes places in England and Wales are provided by the for-profit sector – around 78% in England and 77% in Wales. This compares to 35% in Scotland. Most fostering placements are provided by local authority foster carers – 64% in England, 69% in Scotland and 73% in Wales. However, a significant minority are provided by private providers (except in Scotland where for-profit provision is not permitted) and voluntary providers.

"45",2023-01-31,"The CMA is today starting a programme of work looking into unit pricing practices online and instore in the groceries sector.  Unit pricing shows how much a particular product costs by weight or volume, which helps people identify best value for money.","
    
          In the context of the rising cost of living, people shopping for food and other essential products need confidence that they have the right information to make great choices and are getting fair deals. It is important that shoppers who look at the prices of products should be able to compare like for like.  This, together with recent concerns raised by stakeholders, has led the CMA to revisit the issue of unit pricing.

This new work follows the 2015 Groceries Super-complaint where the CMA considered pricing and promotional practices in the groceries market and concluded that complexities and inconsistencies with unit pricing may prevent people from spotting which deal gives them the best value.

These included:

different interpretations of legibility of unit prices amongst retailers
  inconsistencies with how retailers present unit prices for similar products
  inconsistencies with how retailers present unit prices for products on promotion
George Lusty, Senior Director for Consumer Protection at the CMA said:


  We know that the increased cost of living has hit the pound in people’s pockets.

  That’s why we’re pressing on with this important grocery unit pricing work to ensure shoppers can more easily compare prices and make choices that are right for them.


The project will consider the following:

if the unit pricing issues identified during the 2015 Super-complaint remain
  compliance with the law by retailers
  consumer awareness and use of unit pricing information
The project is at an early stage and the CMA has not formed a view on these issues. The CMA will provide an update on the case page later in 2023.

Sue Davies, Which? Head of Food Policy, said:


  Grocery prices are a huge concern as households all over the country grapple with the cost of living crisis, so it’s timely and important for the CMA to be looking at whether prices are clearly and fairly displayed at the supermarket.

  We know poor, inconsistent and sometimes missing price information is a problem and that’s why Which? is campaigning for pricing transparency from supermarkets, so that shoppers can easily work out which products are the best value.


The project forms part of the CMA’s work to help people, businesses and the UK economy by promoting competitive markets and tackling unfair behaviour outlined in the recent 2023/24 draft Annual Plan.

  CMA Chief Executive: “We’re concerned many shoppers are being misled and potentially even paying a premium for products that aren’t what they seem”


The move is an expansion of ongoing work by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) into ‘greenwashing’, which seeks to get to the bottom of whether products and services that claim to be green or eco-friendly are being marketed to shoppers accurately.

The CMA’s review will examine a wide range of products known as ‘fast-moving consumer goods’ (FMCG). These are essential items used by people on a daily basis and repurchased regularly, such as food and drink, cleaning products, toiletries, and personal care items. In 2021, the average household spent almost £70 a week on food and drink alone, and the FMCG sector as a whole is worth over £130 billion annually.

The CMA will analyse environmental claims made about such products – both online and in store – to consider whether companies are complying with UK consumer protection law. Concerning practices could include the use of vague and broad eco-statements for example packaging or marketing a product as ‘sustainable’ or ‘better for the environment’ with no evidence; misleading claims about the use of recycled or natural materials in a product and how recyclable it is; and entire ranges being incorrectly branded as ‘sustainable’.

Sarah Cardell, Chief Executive of the CMA, said:


  These products are the essentials on everyone’s shopping lists: food and drink, shampoo, laundry detergent, toothpaste, cleaning products. As more people than ever try to do their bit to help protect the environment, we’re concerned many shoppers are being misled and potentially even paying a premium for products that aren’t what they seem, especially at a time when the cost of living continues to rise.

  Our work to date has shown there could be greenwashing going on in this sector, and we’ll be scrutinising companies big and small to see whether their environmental claims stack up. Now is a good time for businesses to review their practices and make sure they’re operating within the law.


The move comes as part of the CMA’s ongoing work into misleading green claims. In January 2022, the CMA turned its eye to the fashion sector, launching enforcement action against well-known fashion brands ASOS, Boohoo and George at Asda in July last year. The CMA wrote to the 3 firms outlining its concerns and the investigation is ongoing.

The CMA also produced the Green Claims Code – a guide to help businesses understand how to communicate their green credentials, while avoiding the risk of misleading shoppers.

How the review develops will depend on the CMA’s assessment of the evidence before it. If the CMA uncovers evidence suggesting green claims could be unfounded, it will consider taking enforcement action using its formal powers – for example, opening an investigation into specific companies.

In its Annual Plan consultation 2023 to 2024, the CMA detailed its strategic priority to continue to take action to accelerate the transition to a net zero economy and promote environmental sustainability.

Hundreds of organisations win cash to run projects for young people and cut crime
  Deputy Prime Minister and Sky Sports’ Jobi McAnuff see sporting success in action at ThruLife


Thousands of at-risk teens are set to pick up their racquets and lace up their football boots as part of a bid to keep them on the straight and narrow, the Deputy Prime Minister has announced today (21 January 2023).

More than 200 grassroots organisations across England and Wales have been awarded cash from the government’s £5 million Youth Justice Sports Fund to run local sports schemes – from climbing to kayaking – that will help keep vulnerable young people away from crime and antisocial behaviour.

The number of children caught up in crime is at a historical low – falling by 81 percent since 2010 but youth crime still costs the taxpayer £1.5 billion a year. Research shows 80 per cent of prolific adult offenders started on their path of crime when children, making the need to steer more young people away from lawbreaking all the more critical.

Announcing the news, the Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab visited ThruLife – one of the projects which have been awarded funding – at a local school in Tottenham, north London.

Joined by ThruLife founder Richard Allicock and Sky Sports pundit Jobi McAnuff, the Deputy Prime Minister swapped into his trainers as he joined penalty practice with youngsters at their after-school football club.

Deputy Prime Minister, Justice Secretary and Lord Chancellor, Dominic Raab, said:


  I know first-hand how powerful sport and mentoring can be in turning young lives around.

  Sport has the power to boost confidence, build resilience and teach discipline, and evidence suggests sports can be effective in reducing offending among young people. That’s why we’re supporting over 200 organisations across England and Wales to encourage more young people to engage with sport and stay away from crime.


One of the surest ways to keep young people on the right path is to give them the skills to succeed in life – something sports schemes can provide, building young people’s resilience, self-confidence and discipline while engaging in a fun activity.

Emerging evidence suggests that sports-based intervention programmes – such as the Youth Sports Fund – can lead to improvements in offending. We know that early intervention done well reduces offending, for example, the

Supporting Families programme showed a 35 per cent reduction in youth prison sentences and a 15 per cent reduction in youth convictions.

Former Crystal Palace midfielder, Sky Sports commentator, and ThruLife ambassador Jobi McAnuff said:


  Organisations like ThruLife do amazing work. I know how important activities and places like this are, and to have positive role models, particularly in areas like this where I grew up.

  You can’t take shortcuts in life, whether that’s to be a professional footballer or whatever you want to achieve. There will be tough times in life, so if you have a passion for something like sport, it can help you to stay positive and committed.


Tom* who regularly attends ThruLife said:


  ThruLife has helped me to grow in confidence through the sports sessions I attend teaching me and others different skills that would better place us on our journey through life, and to help us make positive choices.


Richard Allicock, the founder of Thru Life, said:


  We are delighted to have been awarded this funding, which will help us to continue the positive work that we are doing in the community but also extend our offer to engage with more young people across the borough of Haringey utilising the powers of sport through our mentoring offer.


In November last year, the Deputy Prime Minister invited sports charities and organisations from across the country to bid for the £5 million fund, which saw hundreds of sports schemes apply.

Today, over 200 organisations across England and Wales have been awarded cash to run projects from climbing to boxing with vulnerable teens. Bidders were marked on whether they could show a track-record of helping young people at risk of falling into crime and antisocial behaviour to keep their noses clean.

The £5 million pot of money builds on the government’s existing support for local authorities’ Youth Offending Teams nationwide – which has seen over £730 million worth of funding provided in the last 5 years.

Minister for Sport, Civil Society & Youth Stuart Andrew said:


  We believe every young person should get the best start in life. Doing sport is a brilliant way of building focus and discipline while also improving physical health and stopping people becoming involved in crime.

  This funding will help make sure people are set on the right path from the outset.


The Sports Fund has been co-ordinated by StreetGames and the Alliance of Sport for Criminal Justice, with the support of the Sport for Development Coalition – an umbrella of more than 250 charities in the sports sector.

Stuart Felce, StreetGames Director of Sport and Community Safety, said:


  At StreetGames we believe that community sport, delivered in the right way, can have a transformational impact on children’s lives and the communities they live in. We’re really excited to be partnering with the Sport for Development Coalition and the Alliance of Sport in Criminal Justice to deliver this ambitious new programme from the Ministry of Justice. This investment in sport will support voluntary and community sports organisations to carry out targeted work to enhance positive outcomes for vulnerable children, providing the practical and emotional support they need to grow and helping to keep them and their communities safe.


Hitesh Patel, Executive Director of the Coalition, added:


  Reducing crime and anti-social behaviour is a core element of the Coalition’s #OpenGoal framework, which shows how the multiple returns on investment created by sport for development can help to generate significant public cost savings. We are delighted to be working alongside StreetGames and the Alliance of Sport in Criminal Justice to ensure this new funding supports and strengthens those organisations that can already demonstrate the positive social impact they are having on their local communities.


The funding also delivers on the commitment made in the Prisons Strategy White Paper – published in December 2022 – to cut youth crime and create safer streets.

Notes to editors

Tom’s name has been changed to protect his identity.
  
Over three-quarters of adult prolific offenders received their first caution or conviction as a juvenile.

"48",2023-01-20,"Following an in-depth review, the CMA has found Cérélia’s purchase of Jus-Rol could leave UK retailers and shoppers facing higher prices and lower quality products.","
    
          The CMA has concluded the only way to preserve the degree of competition and choice for consumers is for the Jus-Rol business to be sold to an independent buyer, to be approved by the CMA.

Ready-to-bake products – including staples such as shortcrust and puff pastry, pizza and patisserie dough – are sold in all major food retailers, with UK shoppers spending over £100 million every year on these products. Jus-Rol is by far the largest supplier of branded ready-to-bake products in the UK, while Cérélia is the largest supplier of own-label ready-to-bake products, making these items on behalf of some of the nation’s largest grocery retailers.

In June 2022, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched an in-depth investigation into the deal after an initial Phase 1 investigation identified possible competition concerns. Over the past 7 months, a panel of independent CMA experts has analysed a wide range of evidence from Cérélia and Jus-Rol, grocery retailers and other industry players in order to fully understand the market, as well as the potential impact of the deal.

Following the publication of its provisional findings in November 2022, the CMA has today published its final decision in its in-depth review of the deal.

That decision finds that the merger brings together the 2 leading suppliers in the market by a considerable margin, with ready-to-bake items supplied by Cérélia and Jus-Rol accounting for nearly two-thirds of all such products sold to grocery retailers in the UK.

The evidence gathered by the CMA shows that, while there are differences between the companies’ products, Jus-Rol items compete with supermarkets’ own-label products supplied by Cérélia for the same space on many supermarket shelves.

Evidence from grocery retailers shows that they consider the companies’ products to be important alternatives to one another – particularly because there are few credible alternative suppliers of either branded or own-label products. Grocers also told the CMA that the ability to trade off Jus-Rol against Cérélia, and vice versa, when buying their products allows them to get a better deal for their customers.

The CMA’s investigation found that, at present, the 2 businesses face limited competition, with all other suppliers being far smaller and many of them lacking the capabilities held by Cérélia and Jus-Rol. It is also unlikely that any new supplier would enter the market – or a present supplier expand its activities – in a sufficiently timely way to address the loss of competition brought about by the deal.

Given these findings, the CMA has concluded that the merger would substantially lessen competition, putting UK grocers at risk of higher prices and lower quality products – which could ultimately be passed on to shoppers.

Margot Daly, chair of the independent panel of experts conducting this Phase 2 investigation, said:


  As living costs continue to rise, it’s our responsibility to make sure that competition can play its part in delivering the best possible deals for customers.

  Cérélia and Jus-Rol are the biggest players in this market by far and losing the competition that takes place between them could result in customers facing higher prices and worse quality products. Today’s decision will ensure that doesn’t happen.

"49",2023-01-16,"Sky is the first national provider to help their customers access cheaper broadband by signing up to the Department for Work and Pensions scheme for benefit claimants.","
    
          
    Sky is the first major connectivity provider to join DWP initiative making it easier for benefits claimants to get discounted broadband and mobile tariffs
  
  
    Automatic verification means claimants do not have to repeatedly prove their benefit claim status to access discounted social tariffs
  
  
    Switching to a social tariff could save claimants up to £180 a year
  
This system makes it easier than ever for low-income families to sign up to discounted broadband which could save households as much as £180 a year compared to industry average tariffs.

Introduced last summer, the government scheme lets internet service providers – with claimants’ permission – ask the DWP to automatically verify their customers’ benefit entitlement.

This means people do not need to actively prove they claim benefits whilst on a tariff designed for those on low incomes, as they did previously, often as frequently as every month.

Minister for Social Mobility, Youth and Progression Mims Davies said:


  It’s positive to see a major provider, such as Sky, sign up to our scheme, making it easier for families to access cheaper broadband and mobile tariffs in difficult times, and I call on other providers to follow suit in offering this type of tariff for those in need.

  Claimants who think they might be eligible for one of these tariffs, should contact their provider.

  This is just one of the ways we are working to help households during these tough times as part of the government’s £37 billion support package for those most in need. Do use the DWP benefits calculator, which is a helpful tool for those looking to see if they could access wider support.



Stephen van Rooyen, Executive Vice President & Chief Executive Officer, Sky, UK & Europe, said:


  We know how important connectivity is to our customers, which is why we are focussed on ways we can support them to say online. As well as support with bills, we also provide existing, eligible customers with a broadband and mobile social tariff, helping them stay connected for a significantly reduced cost. The Department for Work and Pensions eligibility tool is a useful step forward, enabling us to more easily confirm eligibility.


Sky and its subsidiary brand NOW join a growing list of providers signing up to the government initiative to help millions access cut price broadband, with WightFibre already signed up to the scheme.

Before the new system was introduced, people were regularly required to verify their entitlement to providers with Jobcentre letters or screenshots of their Universal Credit account.

The availability of social tariffs has been strengthened recently thanks to a drive by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport to encourage telecommunicators to expand their range of cheaper deals.

Broadband social tariff take-up more than doubled in 2022 to 136,000 households and the cross-government Help for Households programme, which aims to help people with the increased cost of living, recently launched a UK-wide public awareness campaign to drive awareness and uptake further.

Those in receipt of benefits interested in exploring broadband tariff options should visit Ofcom’s website to view the full list of options on offer from providers.

Multimillion pound package to help students cover living and other costs.
  Tuition fees frozen for next two years to reduce student debt levels
  Measures are part of government’s drive to support households with the cost of living
Students in need are to benefit from additional financial support designed to ease cost of living pressures and help them to meet everyday costs whilst they are completing their studies.

In recognition of the challenges some students have faced due to the global rise in inflation, the government has announced today (11 January) that it will provide an additional £15 million in hardship funding this financial year so that universities can provide extra support to students that need it most.

It builds on the significant £261 million that the government has already provided to the Office for Students (OfS) for the 2022/23 academic year which universities can draw upon to boost their own hardship funds.

Universities are responsible for ensuring students who need help get the support they need, including through their own hardship funds, or through bursaries and scholarships. Many universities have stepped up their efforts this year offering innovative schemes to support their students. Examples include:

The University of Southampton which has made a total of £1.1 million in the current academic year available to students to cover emergency costs,
  Queen Mary University of London which has a bursary scheme automatically provided to any domestic undergraduate from a family whose annual taxable income is below £20,000, and
  The University of York which announced that £150 would be given to student households who are finding it difficult to pay their bills as part of a £6 million package to support students most in need.
The government has also confirmed today that loans and grants to support undergraduate and postgraduate students with living and other costs will be increased by 2.8% for the 2023/24 academic year.

Minister for Skills, Apprenticeships and Higher Education Robert Halfon said:


  University is an investment, setting students up for future success, helping them to climb
the ladder of opportunity and gain invaluable skills for the world of work.

  We recognise students continue to face financial challenges, which is why we are
increasing loans and grants for living and other costs for a further year.  For the sixth year
in a row, we have frozen tuition fees for a full-time undergraduate course at a maximum of
£9,250 which will reduce the initial amount of debt students will take on.

  To support universities to top up their own hardship funds we are also making an
additional £15 million available. This will bring the total available to universities to draw on
in supporting their students in hardship to £276 million this academic year.

  I’m really pleased to see that so many universities are already stepping up efforts to
support their students through a variety of programmes. These schemes have already
helped students up and down the country and I urge anyone who is worried about their
circumstances to speak to their university.


For the sixth year in a row, the government has confirmed it will freeze tuition fees for a standard full-time course in the 2023/24 and 2024/25 academic year in England at a maximum of £9,250. This move will help provide better value for students by reducing the initial amount of debt students will take on.

The government regularly monitors the interest rates set on student loans against the interest rates prevailing on the market (PMR) for comparable loans. The government confirmed that the maximum Plan 2 and the Postgraduate loan interest rate will be 6.5% between 1 December 2022 and 28 February 2023.

From the 2023/24 academic year, the government will cut interest rates for new students to RPI only so that, under these terms, graduates will not repay more than they originally borrowed, when adjusted for inflation.

"51",2023-01-06,"Changes are being made on 10 January 2023 to ensure individuals receiving cost of living support payments are not disadvantaged when applying for legal aid.","
    
          
Amendments to civil and crime regulations take effect on 10 January to protect legal aid clients receiving cost of living support payments.

Why is this happening now?

Financial support payments are being made by the government to help the vulnerable during the cost of living crisis. Making this change now will align this initiative with legal aid eligibility assessments.

The idea is to ensure funds received under this government initiative do not have to be used to pay for legal services.

Which payments are being disregarded?

The payments which will be disregarded from 10 January 2023 are being made under the:


    Energy Prices Act 2022
  
  
    Social Security (Additional Payments) Act 2022
  
This change means expanding the list of payments to be disregarded when calculating an individual’s financial eligibility for legal aid.

Which areas of legal aid are affected?

The changes, to include these new disregards, will apply to both the civil and criminal legal aid means test schemes. They will come into effect on 10 January 2023.

Where can I find out more?

Amendments to legal aid eligibility legislation can be found in the relevant civil and crime regulations listed below.

We are also updating GOV.UK guidance on 10 January to explain what these payments are and what you need to disregard when making financial determinations.

"52",2023-01-03,"Millions of the lowest-income households across the UK will get up to £1,350 from the Government in 2023/4 to help with the cost of living.","
    
          Millions will receive new cost of living support from Spring 2023, following up to £1,200 in support for over eight million low-income households in 2022
  £900 Cost of Living Payment for means-tested benefit claimants will go direct to bank accounts in three payments over the financial year
  Extra cash support for disabled people and pensioners will see some households receive extra cash
The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has today announced more detail on the payment schedule for the next round of cost of living support unveiled in the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement, building on payments made to over eight million people in 2022.

The new £900 cash boost for over eight million eligible means-tested benefits claimants, including those on Universal Credit, Pension Credit and tax credits, starts in Spring and will go direct to bank accounts in three payments over the course of the financial year. There will also be a separate £150 for over six million disabled people and £300 for over eight million pensioners on top of their Winter Fuel Payments.

Exact payment windows will be announced closer to the time, but are spread across a longer period to ensure a consistent support offering throughout the year. They will be broadly as follows:

£301 – First Cost of Living Payment – during Spring 2023
  £150 – Disability Payment – during Summer 2023
  £300 – Second Cost of Living Payment – during Autumn 2023
  £300 – Pensioner Payment – during Winter 2023/4
  £299 – Third Cost of Living Payment – during Spring 2024
Work and Pensions Secretary, Mel Stride said:


  We are sticking by our promise to protect the most vulnerable and these payments, worth hundreds of pounds, will provide vital support next year for those on the lowest incomes.



  The government’s wider support package has already helped more than eight million families as we continue to deal with the global consequences of Putin’s illegal war and the aftershocks of the pandemic.


Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt added:


  I know these are tough times for families across the UK who are struggling to meet rising food and energy costs, driven by the aftershocks of Covid and Putin’s war in Ukraine.



  That’s why we’re putting a further £900 into the pockets of over 8 million low income households next year. These payments are on top of above inflation increases to working-age benefits and the Energy Price Guarantee, which is insulating millions from even higher global gas prices.



  Tackling inflation is this government’s number one priority and is the only way to ease the strain of high prices, drive long term economic growth and improve living standards for everyone.


If individuals are eligible they will be paid automatically, and there will be no need to apply. Claimants who are eligible for any of the Cost of Living Payments and receive tax credits, and no other means-tested benefits, will receive payment from HMRC shortly after DWP payments are issued.

These payments build on the Government’s extensive support package to help households tackle the globally rising cost of living stemming from the pandemic and the war in Ukraine.

The Government’s Energy Price Guarantee continues to cap energy costs, saving the average household around £900 this winter and a further £500 in 2023/24. Benefits, including working age benefits and the State Pension, will also rise in line with inflation from April 2023, ensuring they increase by over 10%. April will also see the biggest ever cash rise to the National Living Wage, bringing it to £10.42 an hour, and a further year-long extension of the Household Support Fund in England and associated devolved nation funding worth £1 billion in total.

This comes on top of the 2022 support package, which included:

A £650 Cost of Living payment for means-tested benefit claimants, split into two payments, each of which supported over eight million households
  Further £300 and £150 payments, which reached over eight million pensioners and over six million disabled people respectively
  A £150 Council Tax rebate for all households in Council Tax bands A-D
  A £400 energy bill discount for all households, which will continue to run through March"
"53",2022-12-21,"The anticipated joint venture between ForFarmers and Boparan could lead to farmers paying higher prices to feed their poultry, the CMA has found.","
    
          ForFarmers and Boparan (through 2Agriculture) both manufacture and supply chicken and other types of poultry feed in the UK. ForFarmers and Boparan are planning to combine their animal feed milling operations in a joint venture. Between them, the firms operate 19 mills across the UK.

Following its Phase 1 investigation, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has found that the deal raises competition concerns in four local areas across East Anglia, north-western England and North Wales where it could lead to higher prices for poultry feed, lower quality feed or worse quality of service. While both businesses currently compete for customers within each of these local areas, the CMA is concerned that the combined business would not face sufficient competition after the merger.

The CMA is also concerned that the joint venture could unfairly favour Boparan’s chicken farming and processing businesses, resulting in less choice for smaller chicken farmers and processors, who might rely on ForFarmers and Boparan for their chicken feed.

During its Phase 1 investigation, the CMA received a number of complaints from customers and other market participants in relation to the impact this joint venture could have on choice of feed suppliers and poultry feed prices.

Sorcha O’Carroll, Senior Director of Mergers at the CMA, said:


  Feed is the biggest expense faced by farmers when rearing chicken, the UK’s favourite meat.

  With food prices already increasing and the wider cost of living crisis, it is vital that we don’t allow a reduction in competition between poultry feed suppliers, which could make this situation worse - both for farmers and shoppers at the check-out.


ForFarmers and Boparan now have 5 working days to submit proposals to address the CMA’s concerns. If suitable proposals are not submitted, the CMA will progress to an in-depth Phase 2 investigation.

For more information, visit the ForFarmers / Boparan JV case page.

Notes to editors

ForFarmers is a European manufacturer and supplier of animal feed, based in the Netherlands. 2Agriculture, a subsidiary of Boparan, is one of the UK’s largest suppliers of poultry feed by volume produced and uses its production to supply Hook 2 Sisters, a company affiliated with Boparan, as well as farmers on the open market.
  Following a Phase 1 review, the CMA has found that the merger gives rise to competition concerns in the local areas around four of the feed mills operated by the combined businesses, namely in Burston, Bury, Llay and Preston. The combined businesses would account for 50 to 60% of the supply of meat poultry feed to third parties in three of these local areas (Burston, Bury and Llay) and 40 to 50% in the fourth local area (Preston).

"54",2022-12-20,"11.6 million Winter Fuel Payments and Pensioner Cost of Living Payments have been made to pensioners across the UK so far this winter.","
    
          11.6 million Winter Fuel Payments and Pensioner Cost of Living Payments have been made to pensioners across the UK so far this winter.
  This means over 99 percent of eligible pensioners have already received up to £600 to help with their energy bills since the rollout began in November.
  Some payments are continuing into next month – and should arrive by 13 January.
11.6 million Winter Fuel Payments and Pensioner Cost of Living Payments – support worth a total of £4.6 billion – have already been made to pensioners across the UK this winter, the Department for Work and Pensions confirmed today.

The vast majority of these payments – worth up to £600 per household – have landed in pensioners’ bank accounts automatically, directly helping people manage their energy bills and household budgets.

Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride said:


  As the cold weather bites, it is good to be able to confirm that over 99 percent of eligible pensioners have already received as much as £600 to help with their energy bills this winter.

  These payments are just one part of the wider support package we are delivering to help with rising bills, with additional help to follow next year – including the biggest State Pension increase in history.


Pensioners who have not yet received their payment should not be concerned, as payments are continuing into January.  However, pensioners who have not received their payments by 13 January 2023 should contact the Winter Fuel Payment Centre online or by telephone.

The payments appear in bank statements with the payment reference beginning with the customer’s National Insurance number followed by ‘DWP WFP’ for people in Great Britain, or ‘DFC WFP’ for people in Northern Ireland. Pensioners are being asked to double check their bank statements for this reference number before contacting DWP.

The overwhelming majority of Winter Fuel Payments are paid automatically but some people need to make a claim, such as those who qualify but do not receive benefits or the State Pension and have never previously received a Winter Fuel Payment.

Those who need to make a claim have until 31 March 2023 to do so, with further information on who needs to make a claim available on the GOV.UK Winter Fuel Payment page.

Winter Fuel Payments – boosted this year by an additional £300 per household Pensioner Cost of Living payment – are part of an extensive package helping people of all ages with the cost of heating their homes this winter.

This includes providing households with £400 towards their energy bills, with the Government’s Energy Price Guarantee saving the typical household another £900 on top of this.

In addition, millions of payments of up to £650 have already been made this year to low-income households on eligible means-tested benefits as part of the government’s cost of living support. This includes pensioners receiving Pension Credit.

The average Pension Credit award is worth over £3,500 a year and the online Pension Credit calculator is on hand to help pensioners check if they’re likely to be eligible and get an estimate of what they may receive.

Alongside this, households receiving certain benefits – including Pension Credit – could be eligible for extra money between now and the end of March 2023 thanks to DWP’s Cold Weather Payments.

These are an automatic bank top-up of £25, paid to eligible households when the average temperature has been recorded as, or is forecast to be, zero degrees C or below over seven consecutive days at the weather station linked to an eligible person’s postcode. Postcodes already triggered this Winter can be found on the GOV.UK Cold Weather Payments Checker.

Further cost of living support to be paid next year was recently announced by the Chancellor. Payments will include a further £300 for pensioner households, up to £900 for households on means-tested benefits and £150 for those on eligible disability benefits.

          Minister for Pensions Laura Trott urges pensioners to check if they qualify for Pension Credit
  Claims can be made online and over the phone, with the Pension Credit calculator on hand to help pensioners see if they’re likely to be eligible and get an estimate of what they may receive.
Minister for Pensions Laura Trott is today calling on pensioners across the country to check if they are entitled to Pension Credit as soon as possible to ensure they stand the best chance of qualifying for an extra £324 cost of living payment.

Checking eligibility and applying by 18 December 2022 – just ten days away – will mean pensioners could also receive a £324 boost thanks to Pension Credit backdating rules.

This is because successful Pension Credit claims can be backdated for up to 3 months – as long as the applicant was also eligible to receive it during that time.  The average Pension Credit award is worth over £3,500 a year and even a small Pension Credit award can provide access to a wide range of other benefits – such as help with housing costs, council tax or heating bills – in addition to the extra cost of living payments.

Minister for Pensions Laura Trott said:


  The run up to Christmas is always a busy time, but one thing to make sure that’s on your list over the coming days is to find out whether you or your loved ones could be eligible for Pension Credit.



  Pension Credit can make a real difference and I am determined to make sure this support – worth an average of £3,500 per year – is reaching everyone who needs it.


Pension Credit is designed to help people over State Pension age and on a low income with daily living costs, though you do not need to be in receipt of State Pension to receive it.

It tops up a person’s income to a minimum of £182.60 per week for single pensioners and to £278.70 for couples.
To ensure that a successful backdated claim falls within the qualifying period for the extra £324 cost of living help, eligible pensioners are being urged to claim Pension Credit as soon as possible, and by no later than 18 December 2022.

Currently, around 1.4 million pensioners in Britain receive Pension Credit. However, many are still not claiming this extra financial help.

One of those who recently claimed is Arthur from Lincolnshire. After learning about Pension Credit from his neighbour, Arthur successfully applied by calling the Pension Credit claim line on 0800 99 1234.

Arthur said:


  Highly delighted with the Pension Credit award we received – the money was quicker arriving than expected and all in all very pleased with the result. I’d really encourage other pensioners to check if they’re eligible – it’s made a real difference to me.


Pension Credit can be claimed by phone and online, ensuring that older people can apply safely and easily, wherever they are. The online Pension Credit calculator is also on hand to help pensioners check if they’re likely to be eligible and get an estimate of what they may receive.

"56",2022-11-30,"The CMA is investigating Emma Sleep over concerns that some of its online sales practices may breach consumer law.","
    
          As part of its investigation, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will examine whether Emma Sleep has misled consumers by using countdown timers and claims about time limits to imply that a discounted price will end soon, when this may not be the case.

Today’s announcement marks the start of a new programme of consumer enforcement work focused on so-called ‘Online Choice Architecture’ and aimed at tackling potentially harmful online selling practices, including pressure selling tactics such as urgent time limited claims.

The CMA’s consumer enforcement programme will look at online sales practices including;

urgency tactics such as countdown clocks, where sellers put pressure on shoppers to buy quickly
  eye-catching discount offers, such as ‘50% off’ claims, when the real price reduction may not be as great as claimed
Earlier this year, the CMA reported on how the way businesses present information and choices to consumers online can be used to influence people’s purchasing decisions and identified 21 potentially harmful practices which are often used across the online economy.

The CMA also launched its Online Rip-Off Tip-Off campaign earlier this year, which revealed that 71% of people shopping online had encountered misleading selling tactics. The CMA offered tips to help shoppers spot and avoid practices that could result in them being ripped off. Alongside that campaign, the CMA will use its full range of powers to ensure that misleading selling practices are tackled from all angles.

Sarah Cardell, interim Chief Executive of the CMA, said: 


  Nearly all of us shop online and it’s easier than ever to buy something at the click of a button. With the rising cost of living, genuine deals are worth shouting about – but companies using misleading ‘sale’ prices or fake countdown clocks can put unfair pressure on people to buy and could break consumer law.

  The CMA is today reminding businesses they should not use urgency claims to mislead consumers and, if they do, they face the risk of CMA action.

  This investigation into Emma Sleep is just the start of our work into potentially misleading online claims and all sectors are under scrutiny. Companies should take note: look at your own practices and ensure they’re in line with the law.

Notes to editors

The CMA’s investigation concerns Emma Sleep GmbH and other firms in the same corporate group (‘the Emma Group’).
  The CMA will now engage with the Emma Group and gather further evidence to determine whether the CMA considers any of the companies in the group may have broken consumer protection law. The CMA is at the initial stage of its investigation. Accordingly, it should not be assumed that any business under investigation has broken consumer protection law.
  How the case will progress depends on the evidence – this could include the CMA closing the investigation if it believes that consumer protection law is unlikely to have been breached, securing undertakings from the company to address any concerns, or taking court action.
  As an enforcer under Part 8 of the Enterprise Act 2002, the CMA cannot currently levy administrative fines for breaches of consumer law, although the government committed to giving the CMA and other regulators this power in the Autumn Statement on 17 November 2022. At present, the CMA can enforce consumer law through the courts, and where appropriate, seek additional measures to improve consumer choice, drive compliance with the law, or secure redress for consumers.
  The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) issued a ruling dated 16 March 2022 against Emma Matratzen GmbH, a subsidiary of Emma Sleep GmbH, in which the ASA upheld (Complaint Ref: G22-1141037 Emma Matratzen GmbH) complaints relating to the use of misleading reference pricing and a misleading flash sale countdown clock. The ASA found there had been a breach of The UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising and Direct & Promotional Marketing.
  Online Choice Architecture (OCA) is the design of the online environment where consumers interact with businesses.  OCA affects consumer behaviour and can both benefit and harm consumers. The CMA’s discussion paper, ‘Online Choice Architecture: How digital design can harm competition and consumers’, sets out 21 OCA practices showing how consumer decision making can be affected by the structure of choices presented to them, the actual information provided, the way in which that information is provided, and the forms of pressure applied.
  Find out more on the CMA’s consumer campaign on misleading online practices.
  The main consumer protection legislation relevant to the CMA’s concerns about misleading time limited online discounts is the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPRs). The CPRs aim to protect consumers from unfair commercial practices such as the misleading provision or omission of information as part of sales processes.

Summit comes as the government launches a public awareness campaign to raise awareness of cut-price social tariffs
  Attendees identified the barriers for those not currently taking up social tariffs starting at £10
  Minister urged telecoms companies to consider the impact price rises may have on struggling households
The UK’s biggest broadband and mobile operators have today met with the government to follow up on commitments agreed in the summer to support customers with the cost of living.

Digital minister Julia Lopez called together leaders from the telecoms sector - including BT, Virgin Media, O2, Sky, Vodafone, TalkTalk, Three Mobile, Hyperoptic and Ofcom - at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) for an update on work to boost awareness of social tariffs.

Minister Lopez urged the sector to commit to raising awareness of these affordable deals available for people in receipt of Universal Credit, which could save them up to £180 per year when compared to the average tariff.

An Ofcom report in September found that only 31 per cent of eligible groups were aware that social tariffs were available, despite them being available in 99 per cent of the UK to reach those who need the support most.

The meeting took place on the day the government launched a UK-wide public awareness campaign as part of its Help for Households programme. The campaign aims to help people through the cost of living this winter and will help increase awareness and uptake of the cut-price broadband and mobile deals available to help those struggling with bills.

As well as agreeing to make vital steps to make sure eligible customers know about social tariffs starting from as little as £10, the industry agreed to share insight into the barriers beyond consumer awareness that are preventing households from taking up social tariffs.

The Minister also reminded broadband and mobile companies to be mindful of the impact price rises have on households struggling with the global rise in the cost of living.

In a move welcomed by the government, attendee Hyperoptic also marked the occasion by announcing that they will be dropping the price of their fastest speed social tariff from £25 to just £20.

Digital Infrastructure Minister Julia Lopez, said:


  Helping families manage the cost of living is a priority for this winter and beyond. It is vital to find out what more we and the telecoms industry can do to support families worried about their bills.



  Everyone should have access to affordable mobile and broadband services. Today we agreed that more has to be done to raise awareness of social tariffs and stressed the impact price increases have on people and families up and down the country.


Minister for Social Mobility, Youth and Progression Mims Davies said:


  We have already made it easier for vulnerable families receiving certain benefits to access cheaper broadband rates through our automatic verification system. I do welcome today’s discussion which further shows our commitment to working innovatively with industry to keep low-income families connected and able to progress as a result of this support.



  Social tariffs are just one of the ways we are assisting households at this challenging time, with millions already receiving £1,200 in direct payments and more on the way next year. I encourage anyone who thinks they might be entitled to further support to check their eligibility via our online benefits calculator.


The move follows a roundtable in June where the Government and operators agreed a raft of new commitments to support people with rising costs, including more manageable payments and switching to a cheaper deal free-of-charge.

Following this, the Department for Work and Pensions also launched a new service to verify – with customers’ permission – whether they are in receipt of a relevant benefit and therefore eligible for extra financial support such as a social tariff. The new system will simplify the process by removing the need for customers to prove their entitlement to broadband providers as regularly as every month.

ENDS

Notes to Editors

In June, the government agreed five commitments with industry to support customers who may be struggling. These are outlined here.
  A list of the available low-cost social tariffs can be found here.
Marc Allera, CEO BT Consumer brands EE, BT and Plusnet, said:


  Supporting our customers, especially those most in need, is hugely important to us. Our low cost social tariffs for broadband and mobile support those customers who are worried about their finances and need extra help.
“Digital connectivity is increasingly important to everyone, so I’m pleased to join discussions with Ministers and industry leaders on how Government and industry can work better together to develop programs that are both fair and sustainable.”


Nicola Green, Chief Communications & Corporate Affairs Officer from Virgin Media said:


  Virgin Media O2 is committed to supporting digital inclusion and helping our customers through the cost of living crisis.



  We launched our Essential Broadband social tariff over two years ago and since launch have reduced its price and introduced a new tier for customers who want more data.



  We will also expand customer eligibility for Essential Broadband, enabling more people to enjoy broadband at a lower price.  We are delighted, therefore, to support the Government’s campaign to promote broadband social tariffs.


Rocio Concha, Which? Director of Policy and Advocacy, said:


  Social tariffs can be a hugely valuable tool to help people who are struggling financially during the cost of living crisis, yet far too few customers are aware they exist and take up is very low.



  Working together, government and providers have the potential to ensure millions of eligible customers get the vital connectivity they need at an affordable price.


Lindsey Fussell, Ofcom’s Networks and Communications Group Director, said:


  Social tariffs can make a big difference for people who are struggling with rising bills. Since Ofcom started shining a light on this issue two years ago, the number of providers offering them has increased from two to fourteen.



  But millions of eligible households are still missing out on these packages. So there needs to be a much stronger emphasis on offering and promoting them so low-income households can get the help they urgently need.


Dr Emma Stone, Director of Evidence and Engagement from Good Things Foundation said: “


  We want to help everyone and every household stay connected through this crisis. Today’s roundtable, alongside initiatives like our National Databank – gifting free mobile data donated by Virgin Media O2, Vodafone and Three UK – show that there is will and commitment to act together.


Dana Tobak, Chief Executive of Hyperoptic said:


  I’m encouraged to see our industry coming together to address the rising cost of living. At Hyperoptic, we commissioned research to inform measures network operators can take to tackle digital poverty. Since then we have put that research into action with our ‘fair fibre framework’, a list of commitments we are making to support our customers through the rising cost of living.

"58",2022-11-28,"Thousands more people will get access to early legal help over the next 2 years after the government announced £12 million of new grant funding today. (28 November 2022).","
    
          

£12 million to help vulnerable people struggling with legal problems
  focus on early intervention to resolve issues before going to court
  33,000 supported since October 2020


The funding will be awarded to charities and organisations providing support for people facing disputes – helping them to better understand their issues and avoid costly court proceedings.

More than 33,000 people have been supported by organisations receiving similar government grants since October 2020 and nearly two-thirds of cases were resolved before reaching court.

Justice Minister Lord Bellamy said:


  Those who most need support should be able to access it quickly and easily, which is why we’re increasing funding for organisations providing this vital service.

  Early intervention helps prevent people from undergoing lengthy court proceedings - saving time, money and unnecessary stress.


It adds to more than £5 million of investment this year, including a £1 million cost-of-living grant, to help organisations respond to increasing demand for free legal advice. Specialist guidance is offered in person, by telephone or online, to help deal with problems before they escalate or to support those who need to appear in court.

The grant will replace the current Help Accessing Legal Support grant worth £3.2 million which is due to end in June 2023.

The funding benefits people in difficult situations including Helen (not her real name), who was supported by an organisation funded by the grant after leaving an abusive relationship. She continued to suffer harassment from her ex-partner and contacted her local free advice charity who provided guidance on navigating family court proceedings. Helen was able to secure protective court orders aimed at restricting her ex-partner’s access to the family home and preventing violent behaviour against her and her daughter.

Helen said:


  [The advisor] gave me sound legal advice to help me make choices to keep me safe and get my house back.

  If I had not had access to the [advice] it is quite likely that I may have not had the courage or the understanding to go to court to seek these orders, or even worse, that I would have returned to an abusive and volatile relationship as I would not have had any other option.


This legal support is provided by organisations across the country, using the funding where it is needed.

Cara Walker, Mobile Legal Adviser at Norfolk Community Law Service, said:


  Providing outreach legal help to people is vital in a large rural county like Norfolk. The Ministry of Justice funding enables me to work with clients on a long term basis in community settings, who have a range of complex legal problems-including welfare benefits, domestic abuse and immigration.


Cathy Ashley, Chief Executive of Family Rights Group, said:


  Our Advice and Advocacy Service provides social care and legal expertise to families, including parents whose children are in need or subject to child protection enquiries and relatives raising children who cannot live at home.

  The Help Accessing Legal Support Grant is funding our new webchat service for families and is enabling us to provide more intensive support to callers to our advice line, allowing more children to live safely and thrive within their families and safely averting them entering a care system already in crisis.

"59",2022-11-23,"Government is stepping in to provide pensioners with £300 per household, which comes on top of regular Winter Fuel Payments.","
    
          From today, over 11.6 million pensioners will start to receive up to £600 to help with their energy bills this winter, as prices are pushed up by Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine.
  This support, worth over £4.5 billion, is part of an extensive package helping people of all ages with the cost of heating their homes, including through the £400 Energy Bills Support Scheme [available to eligible households in England, Scotland and Wales], and the Energy Price Guarantee saving typical households £900.
From today (23 November 2022), over 11.6 million pensioners in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will start to receive payments of up to £600 to help with their energy bills this winter.

Winter Fuel Payments – boosted this year by an additional £300 per household Pensioner Cost of Living payment – will land in bank accounts over the next two months, the vast majority automatically.

Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride said:


  We want to do everything we can to support pensioners who are often the most exposed to higher costs. That’s why we’re providing all pensioner households with an additional £300 on top of their Winter Fuel Payments to heat their homes and stay warm this winter.



  This extra payment is just one part of the wider support package we’re delivering to help with rising bills, including the biggest State Pension increase in history.



  Our support doesn’t stop here. As we deal with the impact of Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine and the aftermath of the pandemic, we will continue to stand by the most vulnerable, with further cost of living payments coming next year.


The money will appear in bank statements with the payment reference starting with the customer’s national Insurance number followed by ‘DWP WFP’ for people in Great Britain, or ‘DFC WFP’ for people in Northern Ireland.

The overwhelming majority of Winter Fuel Payments are paid automatically but some people need to make a claim, such as those who qualify but do not receive benefits or the State Pension and have never previously received a Winter Fuel Payment.

This month, over seven million payments of £324 have already been made to low-income households as part of this government’s cost of living support. This includes pensioners receiving Pension Credit.

The average Pension Credit award is worth over £3,500 a year, and for those pensioners who may be eligible but are yet to make an application, there is still time to do so and qualify for this additional £324 payment.

This is because Pension Credit claims can be backdated by up to three months, provided the entitlement conditions are met throughout that time.

To ensure that a successful backdated claim falls within the qualifying period for extra £324 cost of living help, pensioners are being urged to claim Pension Credit as soon as possible, and by no later than 18 December 2022.

The online Pension Credit calculator is on hand to help pensioners check if they’re likely to be eligible and get an estimate of what they may receive.

Further cost of living support to be paid next year was announced by the Chancellor in his Autumn Statement last week. Payments will include a further £300 for pensioners, £900 for households on means-tested benefits and £150 for those on disability benefits.

"60",2022-11-19,"Nearly 1,000 prison leavers have been tagged in the first year of a scheme designed to crackdown on booze-fuelled crime.","
    
          

one year since world-first launch of alcohol tagging of prison leavers in Wales
  offenders tagged for up to a year face prison for breaching drink rules
  tags tackling alcohol-fuelled crime which costs society £21 billion a year


Under the scheme, offenders released from prison are fitted with alcohol monitoring tags if their probation officer thinks they are likely to reoffend when drinking. Those who break the rules set by the Probation Service around their drinking face being sent back to jail.

The initiative was launched in Wales last November and rolled out to England in June as part of government plans to stamp out the scourge of alcohol-related crime.

Alcohol plays a part in 39 per cent of all violent crime in the UK and roughly 20 per cent of offenders supervised by the Probation Service are classed as having an alcohol problem.

Around 12,000 orders requiring offenders to wear alcohol tags are expected to be issued over the next three years, covering both prison leavers and those serving community sentences.

Prisons and Probation Minister, Damian Hinds MP, said:


  When more than a third of all violent crime is fuelled by alcohol, these tags provide vital monitoring to help cut reoffending and protect our communities.

  Roughly 12,000 offenders will have benefitted from these innovative tags by 2025 – helping them to make positive changes to their lives and making the streets safer.


The tags help probation officers monitor offenders’ behaviour and support them to turn their backs on crime. They also provide offenders with the incentive to break bad habits as breaching their licence condition could see them back in prison.

Natasha (not her real name), aged 22, from Cardiff, has been on a tag since the beginning of September. She said:


  I was nervous about being tagged but it does help. It’s a physical reminder for me not to drink.

  I’ve been on probation before but this time I’m doing really well. I’m sober and not getting in trouble.


An offender’s licence will stipulate that the alcohol tag must be worn for a minimum of 30 days up to a maximum of one year. Those getting tagged either have a licence condition which requires them to go teetotal or have their drinking levels monitored during this time.

Judges and magistrates have handed down 5,939 alcohol tagging orders to offenders serving community sentences since October 2020.

Last year, the government launched another world-first, using GPS tags to track robbers, thieves and burglars. Around 10,000 tagging orders are expected to be made over the next three years to help stop criminals from reoffending and help police catch them if they carry on.

The move is part of the government’s plan to tackle crime, expanding the use of innovative technology to protect the public and drive down reoffending. The £183 million investment over the next 3 years will nearly double the number of defendants on tags at any one time from 13,500 in 2021 to 25,000 by 2025.

Notes to editors

Reviews are carried out every 3 months to ensure the tag is still necessary, reasonable and proportionate to the risk they pose (a legal requirement).
  The amount of time an offender is required to wear the tag is flexible and could be reintroduced after a year if deemed necessary and proportionate to the risk they pose.
  Recently published statistics show 97% compliance with alcohol bans on community orders.
  
Statistics show that around 20% of offenders managed in the community by the Probation Service had alcohol assessed as a being likely to cause criminal behaviour.
"
"61",2022-11-15,"Over seven million payments of £324 have already been made to low-income families through the government’s cost of living support.","
    
          This means £2.3 billion has been paid out to over 99% of those eligible via DWP across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland since the beginning of the rollout last Tuesday.

A further one million families eligible solely through tax credits will receive their payment between 23 and 30 November.

Eligible claimants who have not yet received their payment should not be concerned, as the DWP expects some payments may take until 23 November to come through. After this date, a GOV.UK page for reporting missing Cost of Living Payments will become available and the DWP will begin processing claims to ensure outstanding payments reach those eligible as quickly as possible.

There are also a small number of cases where an automated payment has not been possible, for example Universal Credit cases where benefit payments are split between a couple, or where the emergency payment system (EPS) cannot recognise their claim details. A dedicated team of agents are currently working through these cases to pay them manually.

Work and Pensions Secretary, Mel Stride said:


  This Government promised to protect those on the lowest incomes, and it is great to be able to confirm today that we have delivered on this commitment with our latest Cost of Living Payment reaching over seven million households in the last week alone.

  This payment is just part of a wider support package the Government has provided, with millions of families benefiting from a Council Tax rebate and pensioners across the country receiving winter fuel support as the weather gets colder and disabled people getting help with additional costs they face. We will continue to support the most vulnerable as we deal with the impact of Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine and the aftermath of the pandemic.



Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt said:


  We know families are struggling with the rising prices caused by Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. That is why we’ve delivered over 7 million cash payments directly into the bank accounts of the most vulnerable households in just one week and will make over a million more to those on tax credits later this month.

  This is part of the £1,200 cash support we’re giving to the poorest members of society during this difficult period.

  At the upcoming Autumn Statement we will continue to prioritise helping the most vulnerable, as we make the tough decisions needed to drive down inflation and fix our public finances.


To be eligible for the £324 Cost of Living Payment, claimants must have been entitled to one of the qualifying benefits between 26 August and 25 September, with the exception of pensioner households, who may be able to have a new Pension Credit claim backdated.

Pensioners have until 18 December to submit a valid claim for Pension Credit, which could entitle them to the £324 Cost of Living Payment. Anyone can check their eligibility for Pension Credit using the online calculator or by calling the freephone claim line (0800 99 1234).

Even if you are not on a qualifying DWP benefit you may still be eligible for the £324 payment, as HMRC is also making payments to over one million families who only receive Working Tax Credit or Child Tax Credit. These will be automatically paid into bank accounts between 23 and 30 November.

Those eligible do not need to contact the government or apply for the payment at any stage. Payments will appear on bank statements with a reference including the recipients National Insurance number followed by:

‘DWP COL’ for those on DWP means-tested benefits
  ‘HMRC COLS’ for those on tax credits only
This is the second instalment of the £650 Cost of Living Payment – part of the Government’s £37 billion support package for households – with millions also benefiting from the £400 grant to help with energy bills and 85% of households in bands A to D receiving the £150 Council Tax rebate.

On top of this, nearly one in 10 people have received the Government’s additional £150 disability payment this Autumn, and an estimated eight million pensioner households will receive an extra £300 in their Winter Fuel Payments this winter.

          Today (15 November 2022), the council transferred its local land charges (LLC) service to the national LLC Register, giving citizens and businesses instant access to the information.

The LLC search is an important part of the conveyancing process, revealing restrictions and prohibitions affecting land and property. Common charges include planning permissions, listed building status and tree preservation orders.

London Borough of Wandsworth Council Leader Simon Hogg said:


  For the first time property buyers in the Wandsworth area will have instant access to LLC information free of charge. Or they can opt to pay £15 for an official guaranteed search.

  The council is absolutely committed to making sure it does everything possible to help people through this crisis. This includes helping property buyers to get the information they need quickly and simply, so their transactions are not compromised.


Property buyers are not the only beneficiaries of a modernised LLC service, local authorities also report increased efficiencies. The transformation of paper, microfiche and electronic charges into digital records provides greater data transparency. Council teams can access the information easily, reducing interdepartmental questions, and increasing speed of service.

Continued monitoring and analysis of the register’s data has also identified opportunities to improve efficiency and reduce potential compensation risks. Recent analysis identified a lapse between a council’s finance and housing department teams, resulting in the delayed registration of housing grant charges. The council had awarded hundreds of grants to local families. A sample test of 10 unregistered charges revealed the council risked losing more than £500,000, because a grant term could not be enforced.

HM Land Registry is working with local authorities to ensure the register continues to deliver service levels that customers expect and deserve. To celebrates local authorities who have outstanding management of the register and communicate well with us, we have launched a new award supported by Land Data.

The Best Performing Migrated Local Authority award is for local authorities who have transferred their data to the LLC Register. From 1 December 2022 to 1 February 2023, HM Land Registry will analyse live register data to identify the most outstanding authority. Four performance indicators will be used when judging. These include the time taken to register new charges, completeness of entries, accuracy of entries and the time taken to correct errors.

We are delighted that an increase in the speed of migrations has resulted in more local authorities joining the register, including Wandsworth Council, which is one of the largest boroughs in London. By 2025, we aim to make all LLC searches in England and Wales accessible online, enabling property buyers, conveyancers, developers, policymakers and innovators to access the information they need instantly.

          The CMA has written publicly to Barclays after the bank failed to send a reminder to customers of payment protection insurance (PPI) policies.

Under the Competition and Markets Authority’s (CMA) PPI order, PPI providers must send annual reminders to customers that set out clearly the cost of their policy, the type of cover they have and remind them of their right to cancel. Barclays breached the order by failing to send reminders to up to 1,306 of its former Mortgage Payment Protection Insurance policy holders between 2014 and 2017.

These customers, who held both a mortgage and an associated PPI policy with Barclays, had moved house and notified Barclays of their new address. Barclays failed to act properly on this information, with affected customers not receiving reminders.

Barclays only discovered this breach in late 2021. Failure to provide these reminders meant that customers may have kept their policies for longer than they needed or stopped checking for cheaper or better alternatives, and this may have cost them money.

The payout, of up to £1m is made up of refunds and goodwill payments, and comes after Barclays reported the breach to the CMA in October 2021, which it is required to do under the PPI order.

Adam Land, Senior Director of Remedies, Business and Financial Analysis at the CMA, said:


  Barclays will pay customers up to £1 million after breaching the CMA’s PPI Order. That’s an average payment of around £750 per customer, which is particularly important as the cost-of-living crisis bites. We will now work with Barclays to ensure these payments are made to customers.

  It’s important that all PPI providers take notice – we won’t hesitate to take action, as we have done here, if customers have lost out.


The CMA cannot currently impose financial penalties on businesses for breaches of this kind but has called for the power to do so.

Imposing fines would allow the CMA to take quicker and stronger action against companies that break the law. It would also allow the CMA to increase the deterrent effect of its enforcement and help ensure businesses take the obligations which the CMA imposes on them seriously for the benefit of UK consumers.

Notes to Editors


    This is not the first time Barclays has breached the order. Find out more about previous breaches and the CMA’s enforcement here
  
  
    We refer to ‘up to’ 1,306 customers because Barclays is still investigating the breach and may find that a small number of these 1,306 customers have in fact received the information they should have done.
  
  
    The CMA does not currently have the power to impose financial penalties for breaches of this kind. The CMA has called for such powers in order to increase incentives for businesses to comply with market and merger remedies. The Government is set to consult on whether the CMA will be given such powers.
  
  
    The CMA’s public letter to Barclays ensures that the bank will contact all customers with a PPI policy, who were affected by the most recent breach, and make payouts to compensate for the missing reminders
  
  
    These breaches will also be logged on the CMA’s register of breaches, which records all breaches of market and merger remedies and is updated quarterly with the next update being January.

"64",2022-11-08,"Almost one in four families across the UK will receive £324 from the government this month as the latest Cost of Living Payments are sent out from today (8 November 2022).","
    
          Over 8 million households in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland who claimed qualifying means-tested benefits during the eligibility period will be automatically paid £324 this month, as part of £1,200 worth of direct help for households.

over 8 million benefit claimants to receive £324 this month as part of Cost of Living support
  
DWP claimants will receive their second Cost of Living payment by 23 November 2022, and eligible tax credit claimants, on no other means-tested benefits, will receive it between 23 and 30 November 2022
  payments will automatically be made to everyone eligible, with no need for anyone to apply
The payments, starting today from the Department for Work and Pensions, are made directly into eligible recipients’ bank accounts, with no need for people to apply or do anything to receive it.

The payment reference on DWP recipients’ bank accounts will be their national insurance number, followed by “DWP COL”. For HMRC recipients the payment reference will be “HMRC COLS”.

Work and Pensions Secretary, Mel Stride said:


  We understand that people are struggling and that is why we’ve consistently acted to ensure millions of low-income families are supported. We will continue to act with compassion as we navigate challenging global economic circumstances.

  As part of a wider £37 billion package of support, this latest £324 payment will help the most vulnerable people in our society who are worrying about their finances through the winter months.


The government’s £1,200 support package contains £400 for energy bills that is being paid in monthly instalments to all domestic energy customers between now and March 2023. It also includes a £150 Council Tax rebate for 85% of all UK households and the previous £326 Cost of Living Payment made by DWP in July and by HMRC in September.

On top of this, nearly one in ten people received the £150 disability payment in September, and a £300 addition to Winter Fuel Payments will go to over eight million pensioner households over the winter.

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt added:


  Prices are rising across the world as we manage the aftershock of COVID-19 and Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. We recognise that families back home are struggling, which is why we’ve taken decisive action to hold down energy bills this winter, and provided hundreds of pounds of cash support for each vulnerable household.

  As part of that support, over 8 million vulnerable households - almost a quarter of families in the UK – will automatically receive a second cost of living payment worth £324 in their bank account from today.

  And while we can’t completely protect people from rising prices, my priority at the upcoming Autumn Statement will be to protect the poorest in society as we take the tough decisions necessary to fix our public finances.


Those eligible to receive the second cost of living payment from today include people on:

Universal Credit
  Income-based Jobseekers Allowance (JSA)
  Income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)
  Income Support
  Pension Credit
To be eligible, claimants must have been claiming and entitled to a payment between 26 August and 25 September 2022, with the exception of pensioner households, who may be able to have a new Pension Credit claim backdated.

They have until 18 December 2022 to submit a valid claim for Pension Credit, which could entitle them to the £324 Cost of Living payment. Anyone can check their eligibility for Pension Credit using the online calculator or by calling the freephone claim line, on: 0800 99 1234.

Even if you are not on a qualifying DWP benefit you may still be eligible for the £324 payment, as HMRC are also making payments to over a million people who receive Working Tax Credit or Child Tax Credit and no other eligible benefits. These will be paid between 23 and 30 November 2022 and customers do not need to contact the government or apply for the payment at any stage.

The £324 payment and the overall £1,200 package come on top of wide-ranging government support with the cost of living this winter, including an extension to the Household Support Fund, which is providing an extra £421 million between October and March to help vulnerable people with the essentials.

As well as this, the Energy Price Guarantee is ensuring people across the country pay significantly less for their energy bills, with a typical household saving around £700 this winter.

"65",2022-11-08,"The purchase of student accommodation provider Student Roost by GIC and Greystar could lead to higher rent and lower quality housing for students in Birmingham.","
    
          The Competition and Markets Authority’s (CMA) phase 1 assessment looked at how the proposed deal could impact students and universities across the UK, focusing on cities where GIC, Greystar and Student Roost have a significant combined presence.

The CMA found the acquisition would not lead to competition concerns in most cities because the combined businesses would continue to face sufficient competition from other accommodation providers. But in Birmingham, the CMA found that the combined businesses would not face enough competition across several university campuses, potentially resulting in higher prices and lower quality services for students.

GIC, Greystar and Student Roost have accepted the acquisition could raise competition concerns in Birmingham and intend to offer remedies to fully address them. The CMA expects to receive their formal proposal within the next 5 working days. Provided the proposed remedy addresses the CMA’s concerns, the merger will be cleared without the need for an in-depth phase 2 investigation.

Colin Raftery, Senior Mergers Director at the CMA, said:


  Aside from fees, rent is the biggest expense students face, and the rising cost of living is putting even more pressure on student budgets.

  Many university towns and cities are already dealing with a student accommodation shortage, which is why it’s crucial that private providers like those involved in this deal are competing effectively.

  We’re concerned this deal could result in students in Birmingham seeing higher prices or lower quality services. GIC, Greystar, and Student Roost have accepted our concerns and have told us that they plan address them. A solution that fully resolves our concerns will avoid the need for a more in-depth investigation.

Notes to editors:

A detailed summary of the CMA’s decision is available on the case page. The full text of the decision setting out the CMA’s investigation and analysis will be published in due course.
  The CMA’s competition concerns relate to 15 university campuses in Birmingham.
  The parties have until 15 November to submit proposals to address the CMA’s competition concerns. The CMA would then have until 22 November to consider whether to accept these in principle or refer the deal for an in-depth phase 2 investigation.

£5 million to keep youths away from crime through sport
  Charities bid to fund grass-roots activities teaching resilience and discipline
  Part of largest youth justice funding package in a generation - making streets safer


Charities across England and Wales will be able to bid for new money to run programmes designed to steer young people away from law-breaking and into positive activities aimed at teaching teamwork, resilience and discipline.

While the number of young people in custody remains at a record low, statistics show around 80% of prolific adult offenders begin committing crimes as children – with the economic and social costs of reoffending costing the taxpayer an estimated £18 billion per year.

The new funding announced today builds on the government’s work to catch and prevent youth offending earlier than ever – helping to prevent these young people becoming involved in crime or anti-social behaviour.

Earlier this year, the Deputy Prime Minister announced the biggest funding package in a generation to tackle youth offending and cut crime, including £60 million for early intervention.

Today’s news also delivers on the commitment made in the Prisons Strategy White Paper – published in December last year – to introduce further measures for early intervention to cut youth crime, keep streets safe and create fewer victims.

Deputy Prime Minister, Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary, Dominic Raab, said:


  I have seen first-hand how local sports projects can transform the lives of young people from tough backgrounds, getting them off the streets and teaching them life skills including teamwork, discipline, and resilience.

  That’s why we’re investing £5 million in innovative sporting schemes up and down the country. It is part of our £300 million investment to support every council across England and Wales in catching and preventing youth offending earlier than ever, making our streets safer.


Charities and organisations wanting to deliver the sports programmes will be able to bid for the money – with hundreds of organisations expected to benefit from the funding.

The Ministry of Justice will work closely with its delivery partner – StreetGames and consortium partners the Alliance of Sport in Criminal Justice and the Sport for Development Coalition – to oversee the application process and delivery of the funding.

Stuart Felce, StreetGames Director of Sport and Community Safety, said:


  We’re really excited to be partnering with the Sport for Development Coalition and the Alliance of Sport in Criminal Justice to deliver this ambitious new programme from the Ministry of Justice.

  These funds are a vote of confidence in the power of sport to provide young people with a positive pathway and to help prevent them from falling into the criminal justice system.

More than one million claimant families receiving tax credits, and no other means-tested benefits, will get their second Cost of Living Payment from Wednesday 23 November 2022, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has confirmed.

This £324 government payment will be paid automatically into most eligible tax credit-only customers’ bank accounts between 23 and 30 November 2022 across the United Kingdom.

Angela MacDonald, HMRC’s Deputy Chief Executive and Second Permanent Secretary, said:


  This second Cost of Living Payment will provide further financial support to eligible tax credit-only claimants across the UK.



  The £324 will be paid automatically into bank accounts, so people don’t need to do anything to receive this extra help.


The second payment will see more than 8 million households across the UK receive their £324 cost of living cash boost by 30 November and follows the first cost of living payments of £326, which eligible families received from Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) from July and HMRC from September.

The government recently announced that households receiving DWP benefits will get their second Cost of Living Payment from 8 November continuing through to 23 November. This includes tax credit claimants who also receive other income-related benefits from DWP.

HMRC is making payments shortly after DWP in order to avoid duplicate payments.

This latest payment comes on top of wider government support with the cost of living this autumn and winter, including:

the £150 Disability Cost of Living Payment, already paid to around 6 million disabled people
  more than 8 million pensioner households who will receive an extra one-off £300 Winter Fuel Payment this year
This is in addition to an extension to the Household Support Fund, which is providing an extra £421 million for use between October 2022 and March 2023 to help vulnerable people with the essentials. A £150 Council Tax rebate was sent earlier this year to those in Council Tax bands A to D in England, creating at least £1,200 in direct support for millions of households.

A £400 reduction on energy bills is also being given to all domestic electricity customers over the coming months, and the Energy Price Guarantee is protecting households from significant rises in their energy bills this winter.

The government is offering help for households. Customers should check GOV.UK to find out what cost of living support they could be eligible for.

          Drive to create more inclusive work environments and equip employers with advice on how people from all backgrounds can thrive at work and grow the economy
  Businesses and disability groups invited to test and shape new service which supports employers to employ more diverse and inclusive workforces
Thousands of businesses across the UK will benefit from a new £6.4 million online service to help employers better support disabled people and those with health conditions in the workplace.

The early test version of the Support with Employee Health and Disability service provides essential information about supporting and managing employees with disabilities or health conditions at work.

Any employer can access the service, which provides free advice on how to manage staff who may be in or out of work with a disability or long-term health condition in a user-friendly online Q&A format.

The service is aimed at smaller businesses, many of which do not have in-house HR support or access to an occupational health service and will help them to build more diverse and inclusive workforces.

The new service also covers potential changes an employer could make to help them return to and stay in work, supporting a government drive to boost numbers of people in employment and ensuring everyone has the opportunity to benefit from being in work.

Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work, Claire Coutinho said:


  Since 2017 we have seen one million more disabled people in work, beating our target by five years. Now we want to go even further by giving more employers the tools and information they need to ensure disabled people and those with health conditions can succeed in the workplace.



  As the new Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work, there is no end to my ambition to build on the success of the Department by making sure disabled people have the same opportunities as everyone else to start, stay and succeed in work.


The site is currently in test mode, with businesses and disability groups invited to have their say through a short online survey, to help shape the future of the service.

The site will be constantly updated and improved over the next three years, informed by feedback given from the survey

The service has been designed to give employers easy access to the advice they need to create the best environments for their staff with disabilities or long-term health issues, so that anyone from any background can start, stay and succeed in work.

Once fully developed, the service will also help employers understand their legal obligations, including how to make adjustments for disabled people and those with health conditions.

Over the next three years, the government will invest £1.3 billion in employment support for disabled people and people with health conditions. This money will go towards building up existing provision, including expanding employment support, to grow the economy and help people with the cost of living.

  The £150 Disability Cost of Living Payment was provided in September, with a £300 additional pensioner payment to come in the Winter
Millions of households across the UK will receive a £324 cost of living cash boost by the 23 of November.

The government has today announced that households receiving DWP benefits will receive the second part of the £650 Cost of Living Payment from 8 November and continuing through to the 23 November.

Over 8  million families have already received the first Cost of Living Payment, worth £326, which was sent out from 14 July this year.

The second payment will automatically be paid into the bank accounts of those eligible in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland who receive a qualifying benefit, meaning they will not need to do anything to receive the money.

Work and Pensions Secretary, Chloe Smith said:


  Millions of families will soon see a £324 cash boost as part of our extensive £1,200 support package, helping to raise incomes and manage the rising cost of living.

  We understand that people are struggling which is why and we’re committed to supporting the most vulnerable households. That’s also why we are focused on driving growth and delivering quality public services so we can continue to support those in need through these challenging times while boosting opportunity for all.


Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kwasi Kwarteng added:


  We know that people have been worried about their bills ahead of this winter, which is why we’ve taken decisive action to hold down energy bills, saving the average household around £1,000 a year, and provided £1,200 of targeted support to the most vulnerable.

  Without our intervention, analysts were predicting that the average annual energy bill could have reached £6,500 next year. We were never going to let this happen.

  Our Growth Plan will also leave more money in people’s pockets and, over the longer term, help drive economic growth – the only way to permanently boost everyone’s living standards.


The DWP will pay a small number of payments on the 8 November, with numbers increasing significantly from the 9 November. Even if you are not on a qualifying DWP benefit you may still be eligible for the £324 payment as HMRC are also making payments to those who receive tax credits and no other eligible benefits. These will be paid shortly after DWP payments and customers do not need to contact the government or apply for the payment at any stage.

This payment comes on top of extensive government support with the cost of living this winter, including around 6 million disabled people having been paid a separate £150 Disability Cost of Living Payment, whilst over 8 million pensioner households will receive an extra one-off £300 Winter Fuel Payment this year. This is in addition to an extension to the Household Support Fund, which is providing an extra £421 million for use between October and March to help vulnerable people with the essentials.

As well as this, a £150 Council Tax rebate was sent earlier this year to those in Council Tax bands  A to D in England, creating a total of at least £1,200 in direct support for millions. A £400 reduction on energy bills is also being given to all domestic electricity customers over the coming months, and a new ‘Energy Price Guarantee’, which means from 1 October the average UK household will save at least £1,000 a year based on current energy prices.

The vast majority of eligible claimants who were due to receive the one-off £150 payment from the DWP by early October have now had their payment processed.

The payment will help disabled people with the rising cost of living, acknowledging the higher costs they often face, such as for care and mobility needs.

There will be some cases – such as those who gained entitlement to this payment at a later date or where payments were rejected due to invalid account details – who will not be paid by the beginning of October. These will be paid automatically as soon as possible.

The £150 cost of living payments for disabled people from the government are part of a £37 billion package of support, which will see millions of low income households receive at least £1,200 this year to help cover rising costs.

"74",2022-09-27,"The CMA has imposed fines totalling over £2 million on Elite Sports, JD Sports and Rangers FC after they admitted to fixing the prices of certain Rangers FC merchandise.","
    
          The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has found that Elite Sports and JD Sports broke competition law by fixing the retail prices of a number of Rangers-branded replica kits and other clothing products from September 2018 until July 2019. Rangers FC also took part in the collusion but only to the extent of fixing the retail price of adult home short-sleeved replica shirts from September 2018 to mid-November 2018. All 3 firms colluded to stop JD Sports undercutting the retail price of the shirt on Elite’s Gers Online store.

Elite Sports has been fined £459,000, JD Sports £1,485,000 and Rangers £225,000. The penalties include a settlement discount, reflecting resource savings to the CMA as a result of all 3 parties admitting to acting illegally and helping bring a swifter resolution to the CMA’s investigation. Elite Sports’ and JD Sports’ penalties also include a discount for coming forward with information about their participation in the illegal conduct and cooperating with the investigation under the CMA’s Leniency Programme.

Michael Grenfell, Executive Director of Enforcement at the CMA, said:


  At a time when many people are worried about the rising cost of living, it is important that football fans are able to benefit from competitively priced merchandise.

  Instead, Elite, JD Sports and, to some extent, Rangers, worked together to keep prices high.

  Today’s decision sends a clear message to football clubs and other businesses that illegal anti-competitive collusion will not be tolerated.


During the time of the infringement, Elite was the manufacturer of Rangers-branded clothing and also sold Rangers-branded products directly through its Gers Online store and later in bricks-and-mortar shops in Glasgow and Belfast. The only UK-wide major retailer selling those products at the time was JD Sports.

The CMA’s investigation found that Rangers FC became concerned about the fact that, at the start of the 2018 to 2019 football season, JD Sports was selling the Rangers replica top at a lower price than Elite, which was seen at the time as the club’s ‘retail partner’. This resulted in an understanding between the 3 parties that JD Sports would increase its retail price of the Rangers adult short-sleeved home replica shirt by nearly 10%, from £55 to £60, to bring it in line with the prices being charged by Elite on Gers Online.

The CMA also found that Elite and JD Sports – without involvement from Rangers – colluded to fix the retail prices of Rangers-branded clothing, including training wear and replica kit, over a longer period. This included aligning the level and timing of discounts towards the end of the football season in 2019, to avoid competition between them and protect their profit margins.

  We know disabled people face additional costs and this government is listening and taking decisive action to protect the most vulnerable in our society.

  In addition to the £150 Disability Cost of Living payment, households will save an average of £1,000 a year through our new Energy Price Guarantee and the lowest-income households will receive at least £1,200 to help with the rising cost of living this year.

  This multi-billion-pound package of support reinforces our commitment to help UK households, particularly those with disability challenges, through the tough times ahead.


UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng said:


  The government is providing vital support to shield the most vulnerable from rising prices caused by global economic challenges.

  From today, a one-off £150 payment will automatically land in over six million disabled peoples’ accounts. This is in addition to the decisive action we took last week to hold down energy bills over the next two years, saving the average household £1,000 a year.

  The government is standing behind people this winter, and in the longer term we are focusing on driving economic growth – the only way to permanently boost everyone’s living standards.

"76",2022-09-08,"The CMA’s initial investigation into Morrisons’ completed purchase of McColl’s shops has found competition concerns in 35 local areas where the 2 brands compete.","
    
          However, overall, the deal would not harm the vast majority of shoppers or other businesses.

On 13 July 2022, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched its investigation after the companies submitted the reported £190 million deal for review.

McColl’s operates convenience newsagent shops, with over 1,100 stores across England, Scotland, and Wales, while Morrisons (owned by parent company Clayton, Dubilier & Rice ‘CD&R’) has around 500 grocery stores in the UK. CD&R is also the parent company of the Motor Fuel Group (MFG). MFG owns over 800 convenience stores, the vast majority of which are attached to its petrol stations.

Following its Phase 1 investigation, the CMA has found that the merger between Morrisons and McColl’s raises competition concerns in 35 areas, where McColl’s or MFG convenience stores will face reduced competition if the deal is allowed to go ahead as planned. Weaker competition could lead to higher prices or a lower quality service for the customers in these areas who rely on their local shops for groceries.

During the investigation, the retailers accepted that the merger would raise concerns in some areas and asked the CMA to move straight to a discussion of remedies to address these concerns.

Morrisons now has 5 working days to offer proposals to the CMA to address the competition concerns identified. The CMA would then have a further 5 working days to consider whether to accept these in principle instead of referring the case to a Phase 2 investigation.

Sorcha O’Carroll, CMA Senior Director of Mergers, said:


  As the cost of living soars, it’s particularly important that shops are facing proper competition so that customers get the best prices possible when picking up essentials or doing the weekly shop.

  While the vast majority of shoppers and other businesses won’t lose out, we’re concerned that the deal could lead to higher prices for people in some areas. If Morrisons and McColl’s can address these concerns, then we won’t need to move on to an in-depth investigation.

  In the meantime, we’re working closely with Morrisons to ensure that it can provide the support that McColl’s needs to continue to operate during our investigation.

"78",2022-09-02,"Waitrose has agreed to rewrite several property deals after it signed land agreements which blocked other supermarkets from opening nearby.","
    
          

Waitrose re-writes land deals to allow rivals to open nearby
  “We will continue to take action when our rules are broken”, says CMA’s Adam Land


Waitrose admitted to a total of 7 breaches of the Groceries Market Investigation (Controlled Land) Order 2010 between 2010 and 2019 after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) took a closer look at how supermarkets were competing. The Order was brought in by the CMA to ensure supermarkets cannot use restrictive terms to prevent rivals from opening stores.

By helping supermarkets to compete freely, the Order aims to ensure that shoppers have more choice and so benefit from a wider range of groceries and access to cheaper prices – which is even more important as the cost of living rises.

To comply with the Order, Waitrose has agreed to remove restrictions from land agreements which prevented rivals from setting up new stores.

The 7 breaches relate to the following locations, where Waitrose operate existing stores:

Bromsgrove
  Rustington
  Swindon
  Daventry
  Chester
  Notting Hill Gate
  Market Harborough
Adam Land, Senior Director of Remedies at the CMA, said:


  It’s disappointing that Waitrose has acted against the interests of shoppers, despite these rules having been in place for over 10 years.

  Families across the UK are facing the rising cost of living. Preventing other supermarkets from opening new stores could stop people saving on their weekly shop.

  Waitrose is now putting this right so that everyone gets a fair deal. We will continue to take action when our rules are broken, and we have asked all supermarkets to show us their land deals comply with the Order.


The announcement today follows similar changes from Tesco in 2020 after the CMA found it had breached the same rules 23 times.

Notes to editors


    The CMA’s letter sent to Waitrose is publicly available and sets out the CMA’s responseis to the seven breaches reported by the supermarket.
  
  
    The CMA’s assessment of land deals by other supermarkets covered by the Order is ongoing.
  
  
    While the CMA does not currently have the power to fine those who breach the Order, the government is currently considering giving the CMA these powers.
  
  
    The Groceries Market Investigation (Controlled Land) Order 2010 banned new restrictive covenants, which prohibit a piece of land from being used for a supermarket, when it came into force in 2010.
  
  
    The Order also banned Exclusivity Arrangements (which prevent landlords from allowing competing stores in the same block as an existing supermarket) which were over 5 years long.

Around 9 out of 10 of eligible households have received £150 cost of living rebate
  Anyone yet to receive the rebate can make a claim to local authority
  Rebate part of £37 billion of government support to tackle cost of living crisis


Around 90% of eligible households have received the government’s £150 council tax rebate to help with the cost of living.

Figures published today show 16.6 million households in England, 86% of those eligible, were handed payments by the end of July – meaning the actual number of those who have received the rebate by now will be even higher as councils continue to pay it out.

Today’s figures show a total of £2.5 billion has gone to households in council tax bands A to D under the scheme, an increase of more than £500 million on the previous month.

All councils in England have begun making these payments and have payment processes in place for people who do not pay by direct debit. DLUHC will continue to drive progress with councils to pay households as soon as possible where they have not already done so.

Households have until the end of September to claim the £150 payment, which does not have to be paid back. Anyone who is yet to receive their rebate is urged to check their local council website for more information and make a claim.

However, recognising the importance of the rebate in helping those most in need with rising costs, the government urges councils to do everything they can to encourage the remaining households to claim their rebate to ensure as many eligible households as possible get the money that they are owed.

An extra £144 million has also be given to councils to provide discretionary support to any household in financial need due to rising energy bills, including transient groups and people on low incomes in council tax bands E to H.

Levelling Up Secretary Greg Clark said:


  I’m pleased to see further progress in paying the council tax rebate out to the millions of households who are eligible to receive it.

  We want to make sure that those most in need receive the support that they are entitled to help households with the cost of living. This is why I am urging everyone to check their eligibility to receive the rebate and contact their councils if they have not.


The rebate is part of £37 billion of government support being targeted at those most in need to help with the cost of living. This includes at least £1,200 of extra support for millions of the most vulnerable households this year, with all domestic electricity customers receiving at least £400 towards their bills.

The rebate is available to most households living in council tax bands A to D on 1 April. This includes those who receive Local Council Tax Support, even if their council tax bill for the year is less than £150.

Anyone who thinks they are eligible but does not have a direct debit and has not received a payment or details of how to make a claim, should visit their local council’s website for more information.

Since announcing the rebate in April, the government has provided £28 million for councils to set up software and recruit staff and will top this up as necessary to cover all reasonable delivery costs. Councils have been given a host of options to make payments quickly and securely including bank account transfers, council tax account credits or a voucher-based system.

Local authorities must also make arrangements for those who cannot access the internet.

If households do not know who their local council is, they can find their website through entering their postcode.

"80",2022-08-31,"Under the proposals being consulted on, a cap on social housing rent increases would be put in place for the coming financial year, with options at 3%, 5% and 7% being considered.","
    
          

Social rent cap proposed to support tenants with cost of living
  Move could save households £300 per year and provide financial stability for 4 million families
  Part of government’s efforts to support most vulnerable households


A consultation has been launched today (Wednesday 31 August) to invite views from social housing tenants and landlords on a proposed rent cap to understand how best to support households with the cost of living.

Under the proposals, a cap on social housing rent increases would be put in place for the coming financial year, with options at 3%, 5% and 7% being considered.

The move would prevent rents for council and housing association houses from rising significantly, saving tenants an average £300 per year and providing stability as inflation rises.

The government regulates how much social housing rents can increase each year. Currently this is set at up to the consumer price index (CPI) rate plus 1% – meaning potential increases next year of 11% in line with recent Bank of England forecasts.

The proposed new cap will help support the most vulnerable households in the face of cost-of-living pressures. This comes on top of our existing £37 billion support package, which includes a £150 council tax rebate, a £400 energy bill discount to support households over the coming months and the most vulnerable 8 million households receiving support of at least £1,200.

Housing Secretary Greg Clark said:


  We must protect the most vulnerable households in these exceptional circumstances during the year ahead. Putting a cap on rent increases for social tenants offers security and stability to families across England.

  We know many people are worried about the months ahead. We want to hear from landlords and social tenants on how we can make this work and support the people that need it most.

  The rent cap would be temporary and would apply from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024. The consultation also seeks views on whether to set a limit for 2024-25. The government understands this will impact social housing landlords and is engaging fully with the sector.


Following the consultation, a final decision will be announced later this year, to make sure social housing landlords have enough time to factor this into their rent decisions for April 2023.

The government is also committing to reviewing social rent policy beyond 2025, via a separate consultation due to be launched next year.

Today’s announcement is part of measures the government has put in place to support the most vulnerable households with the cost of living.

This is in addition to the £11.5 billion investment to build more affordable, quality homes through the Affordable Homes Programme.

Geeta Nanda OBE, Chair of the G15 group of leading housing associations and Chief Executive of MTVH, said:


  We are deeply concerned by the impact cost of living pressures are having on the people we provide homes to. G15 members have increased support for residents, including providing additional funding for vital crisis support, on top of the work we are doing to bring down people’s energy bills by improving the energy performance of the homes we provide. The support government has announced for energy bills is welcome, but it is clear that further assistance is urgently needed.

  All G15 members recognise the current high rates of inflation and are considering the impact of this on residents and the essential work we do carefully. To maintain and improve existing residents’ homes, as well as continuing to build much needed new affordable homes, significant investment each year is essential. Rental income is critical to supporting this work. Housing associations have already seen costs for vital materials for repairs and maintenance work increase by as much as 16.8% this year, and the cost of constructing new homes has grown by more than 11% as well.

  In getting the balance right on rent setting, we are committed to maintaining affordability for residents. We welcome the government’s consultation and the opportunity to discuss these important issues further.

"81",2022-08-25,"Around 1.1 million claimant families receiving tax credits will get their first Cost of Living Payment from Friday 2 September 2022, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has confirmed.","
    
          
This £326 government payment will be paid automatically into eligible tax credit-only customers’ bank accounts between 2 and 7 September 2022. The first HMRC payments will total around £360 million.

Nadhim Zahawi, Chancellor of the Exchequer, said:


  I know people are really concerned by rising prices so I’m glad that over a million more low earners will shortly receive their first Cost of Living Payment. We are also preparing options for further support so the new Prime Minister can hit the ground running.



  Alongside £400 off most people’s energy bills, tax cuts and the Household Support Fund, these direct payments are a very important part of our £37 billion package of help for households, which is targeted at those who need it most.


Angela MacDonald, HMRC’s Deputy Chief Executive and Second Permanent Secretary, said:


  This first Cost of Living Payment will provide vital financial support for eligible tax credit-only claimants across the UK. A second payment will be made to eligible customers from the winter.



  The money will be paid automatically into bank accounts, so people don’t need to do anything to get this extra help.


These latest payments mean that more than eight million eligible households in receipt of a means-tested benefit will have received the first of two automatic Cost of Living payments of £326 from 14 July. The second means-tested payment of £324 will be issued later this year – from the autumn for Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) benefit claimants, and from the winter for tax credit-only customers.

Tax credit claimants who also receive benefits from the DWP will have already received their first Cost of Living Payment from July 2022.

The Cost of Living payments from the government are part of a £37 billion package of support, which will see millions of low-income households receive at least £1,200 this year to help cover rising costs.

As well as the Cost of Living Payment, other government support includes:

£400 discount from the government to help with the cost of energy bills from October onwards
  £150 council tax rebate for council tax bands A-D in England
  £300 Pensioner Cost of Living Payment that will be paid alongside Winter Fuel Payments
  £150 Disability Cost of Living Payment from 20 September for those receiving an eligible UK disability benefit
This is all in addition to changes to the Universal Credit taper rate and work allowances worth £1,000 a year on average for 1.7 million working claimants; a rise in the National Living Wage to £9.50 an hour; and a tax cut for around 30 million workers through a rise in National Insurance contribution thresholds.

The government is offering help for households. Customers should check GOV.UK to find out what cost of living support they could be eligible for.

"82",2022-08-25,"Prior to the merger, Veolia and Suez were 2 of the largest suppliers of waste management services in the UK.","
    
          The CMA has today required Veolia to sell 3 businesses after an in-depth merger investigation concluded the merger gives rise to competition concerns in a number of markets.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has concluded that Veolia must sell substantial parts of the merged business:


    Suez’s UK waste management services businesses;
  
  
    Suez’s UK industrial water operation and maintenance services business; and
  
  
    Veolia’s European mobile water services business.
  
These businesses make up almost all of the overlap between Veolia’s and Suez’s competing operations in the UK.

In response to the provisional findings of the Phase 2 inquiry, Veolia said that it would sell the UK Suez waste business. The CMA will determine the conditions of the sale, as well as the sales of the 2 water services businesses.

The CMA will need to approve the purchasers of each business before the completion of each sale.

Veolia and Suez are both global players in waste and water management. In 2020, the companies generated approximately £2bn and £1bn in the UK respectively – roughly 10% and 7% of their annual global revenues.

Veolia and Suez are active across the full waste management supply chain. They collect waste from households and businesses, sort it for recycling and composting and dispose of the remaining waste – some of which is incinerated to produce electricity. Many local authorities in the UK rely heavily on either Veolia or Suez to meet their waste management needs. The companies also supply water and wastewater management services to industrial customers.

Throughout the investigation, the CMA heard from a number of councils  and customers who were concerned about the potential impact of the merger on the cost and quality of the services they receive. Ultimately, taxpayers and businesses would have been left to cover any increase in cost.

Stuart McIntosh, Chair of the CMA inquiry group, said:


  Local authority budgets are already under strain, and this deal is likely to lead to them paying more and receiving a lower-quality service. The negative impact would have ultimately fallen on taxpayers at a time when they are feeling the pressure of the cost of living crisis.

  Given our concerns about the merger, we have concluded that Veolia must sell most of the operations it took over in the UK when it acquired Suez. We will now work with Veolia to ensure that appropriate buyers are found so that businesses, councils – and ultimately taxpayers – will not lose out.


The CMA’s final report, published today, confirms its provisional findings issued in May. It rules that the merger would lead to competition concerns in 5 waste markets and 2 water treatment markets. In each of these markets, the merging businesses currently compete closely and would face limited competition after the merger. The CMA found that this would be likely to result in higher cost or lower quality services for councils, with knock-on effects for taxpayers, as well as businesses across the UK.

The CMA launched an investigation into the deal between Veolia and Suez in October 2021. The transaction was referred for an in-depth Phase 2 review, which is led by an independent inquiry group, in December 2021.

This deal has been reviewed by a number of competition authorities across the world. Major divestments were also required in the EU and in Australia.

    The CMA found that the merger would lead to a Substantial Lessening of Competition (SLC) in the following areas:
  

    Collection of non-hazardous waste for municipal customers;
  
  
    Operation and maintenance of material recovery facilities (i.e. sorting of waste after collection) for municipal customers;
  
  
    Operation and maintenance of Energy Recovery Facilities (i.e. incineration) for municipal customers;
  
  
    Supply of incineration services to customers in 2 local areas;
  
  
    Collection of non-hazardous waste for commercial and industrial customers;

The payment will help disabled people with the rising Cost of Living acknowledging the higher disability-related costs they often face, such as care and mobility needs.

For those disabled people on low-incomes, this payment comes on top of other Cost of Living payments totalling £650, £400 for all households to help with energy bills, and an extra £150 for properties in Council Tax bands A-D in England.

Over eight million eligible households in receipt of a means-tested benefit received the first of two automatic Cost of Living payments of £326 from 14 July. The second means-tested payment of £324 will be issued later this year.

Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work Chloe Smith said:


  We know disabled people can face additional costs, which is why we are acting to help reduce the financial pressures on the most vulnerable.



  This £150 disability payment is on top of the £1,200 most low income benefit claimants will also receive and alongside wider support targeted at disabled people, including help with transport and prescription costs.



  We know it’s a worrying time for some people and I’d urge them to check they are getting all the support on offer by searching Help for Households.


The Cost of Living payments from the government are part of a £37 billion package of support, which will see millions of households receive at least £1,200 this year to help cover rising costs.

The government has also expanded support for the Household Support Fund in England – which helps people with food and energy bills – with an extra £421 million – for October 2022 to March 2023, and topped up funding by £79 million for devolved nations; the total value of this support now stands at £1.5 billion.

This is all in addition to changes to the Universal Credit taper rate and work allowances worth £1,000 a year on average for 1.7 million working claimants, a rise in the National Living Wage to £9.50 an hour, and a tax cut for around 30 million workers through a rise in National Insurance contribution thresholds.

UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Nadhim Zahawi said:


  We know that rising prices faced by many countries around the world are a significant worry for many people here in the UK, especially those most vulnerable to additional costs.



  Today’s announcement that disabled people will begin to receive an additional £150 payment from the end of September reinforces our commitment to help UK households through the challenging times ahead.



  This payment is in addition to further help households can expect over the coming months – including a second cost of living payment of £324 for households on means-tested benefits, £300 for pensioners this winter and £400 discount on energy bills for every household. This is all part of our significant £37 billion support package.

BVA BDRC (which covers business current accounts)
Following its investigation into the retail banking sector, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) made it compulsory for all relevant banks to take part in these surveys, so customers get the full picture. Account providers must display their ranking prominently both in branch and on their websites and apps.

Personal and small business current account holders were asked how likely they would be to recommend their provider to a friend, relative or other business. The survey also covered the quality of online and mobile provision, branch and overdraft services and, for small businesses, the quality of the relationship management they receive.

The results show customers how their bank is ranked on overall quality of service and make it easier for people to compare offers. They also promote competition between providers, resulting in better experiences for all account holders.

Adam Land, Senior Director at the CMA, said:


  As the rising cost of living bites, it’s important that people and businesses have the information they need to manage their money and make savings.

  These results show how banks are treating their customers at a time when many are feeling the pinch.

  When times are tough you find out who’s fighting your corner and if your bank doesn’t match up to the competition – you can vote with your feet and make a switch.


If you’ve found another bank that could give you a better deal, the Current Account Switch Service helps to make the process of switching much simpler. This free service is available to anyone with a personal or business current account in the UK.

Check the list of participating banks and building societies to make sure you can use the Current Account Switch Service.

The survey was established as part of the Retail Banking Order - a set of reforms established by the CMA following its retail banking market investigation in 2016.

The CMA enforces the Retail Banking Order, and regularly checks that banks are doing what they’re required to do. If the CMA finds the Order is being breached, it can take action. Learn more about what happens when banks breach the Order.

          The scheme, being run at HMP Hewell in Worcestershire, is part of a landmark trial between the prison and farming technology company, LettUsGrow, that will see prisoners grow leafy greens, salad and herbs in high-tech ‘vertical’ farms.

Vegetables are grown in compact towers using aeroponics using an air or mist environment rather than soil.

At the forefront of farming, this advanced technology produces more plants, more quickly and with 98 percent less water than conventional methods.

Most importantly, the scheme will train prisoners up in the jobs of the future, such as farm management software, plant science and food safety. This will help them find a job on release in new and emerging technologies and dramatically reduce their chances of reoffending.

This is just the latest move in the government’s strategy to make sure prisoners use their time behind bars to get the skills they need to find work once through the gate and back home.

Prisons Minister Stuart Andrew MP:


  This innovative scheme is just the tip of the iceberg in our drive to equip prisoners with the practical skills they need to get a job on release – ultimately cutting crime and keeping the public safe.

  Up there with education, family ties and addiction treatment, stable work holds the key to a life free from crime and safer communities for us all.


Ralph Lubowski, Governor of HMP Hewell:


  I am delighted to partner with Lettus Grow in this fantastic initiative, which will give our prisoners the opportunity, confidence and training to turn their lives around.

  Vertical farming is an innovative, emerging industry and this partnership highlights our commitment to ensuring that prisoners are skilled up to find work on release.


The latest figures show the number of former offenders in work six weeks after release has increased by nearly half, whereas proven reoffending has fallen to just over 25 percent - making huge progress in tackling the £18 billion cost of repeat offending and keeping the public safe.

Notes to editors


The latest statistics from the Ministry of Justice show that the proportion of persons released from custody who were employed at 6 weeks from their release rose by 6 percentage points to 16 per cent between April 2021 and March 2021. This is an increase of more than half (57 per cent).
  New data shows that over the last 10 years, proven reoffending has decreased from 30.9 percent (2009/10) to 25.6 percent (2019/20).
  The Prisons White Paper – the Deputy Prime Minister’s strategy to reduce reoffending and keep the public safe – puts a laser-sharp focus in getting prisoners into work both behind bars and on release.

          8.9 million grants given to families in first round of Household Support Fund, new data shows
  Local Authorities use government funding to help communities with innovative measures
  It “has been an important intervention to provide Help for Households”, minister says
The vital support was given to families in England from the Household Support Fund in the first six months of its introduction, with £400 million spent in support and given directly to those in need.

The Fund has since been extended to the end of March 2023 after receiving another £842 million in funding through two extensions.

Local Authorities administer the fund on behalf of the government to help vulnerable households across the country access support to help with the rising costs of energy, food, water and other related essentials.

Department for Work and Pensions Minister for Welfare Delivery, David Rutley said:


  The Household Support Fund has been an important intervention to provide Help for Households facing challenges with the cost of living.

  Local Authorities know what support works best in their areas. It has been good to see the different ways they have used the Fund to enrich the lives of people in their communities.

  With the extensions announced, Local Authorities can now provide that vital support through Christmas and beyond.


The latest figures show how the first round of the Fund was used from October 2021 to March 2022. Almost nine million instances of support were given to families who need it most across England.

Those in need of support were told to apply for, or directly received, the help through their local authority, and councils were empowered to use the Fund to support their communities in a way tailored to their needs. It’s clear from the latest data that many around the country have found the Fund useful.

In Leicestershire, the local authority partnered with Leicester City Football Club to put on community cooking events, providing nutritious meals for families while also improving their cooking skills to prepare healthy meals at home. In Darlington, the council worked with local organisations to give families end-of-day supermarket goods at a fraction of their usual cost.

London’s Lambeth Council has used some of its allocation to help fund its Healthy Living Platform food boxes for harder to reach communities, while Rochdale set up a community warehouse that distributed over 700 winter packs with blankets and sanitary products.

To access the latest round of funding available people should contact their upper tier local authority and ask what help is available through the Household Support Fund in their area.

By the end of March 2023, £1.262 billion in additional support will have been given out in England to help people with rising costs. Devolved governments will have received a total of £238 million through the Barnett Formula.

"87",2022-07-28,"Nearly 80% of eligible households received the government’s £150 council tax rebate in the first 3 months to help with the cost of living, figures published today show.","
    
          
A total of more than £2 billion has been handed to 15 million households in England under the scheme. Over 90% of households who had direct debits set up with their local council have received their council tax rebate.

The figures cover the period to the end of June, meaning the actual number of households who have received the rebate is likely to be even higher as councils continue to pay it out.

All councils have begun making these payments and almost all councils have payment processes in place for people who do not pay by direct debit. Minister for State Paul Scully has spoken to the 4 councils who do not yet have these processes in place to ensure that they do so as soon as possible.

Households have until the end of September to claim the £150 payment, which does not have to be paid back. Anyone who is yet to receive their rebate is urged to check their local council website for more information and make a claim.

However, recognising the importance of the rebate in helping those most in need with rising costs, the government urges councils to keep pace in supporting the remaining households to claim their rebate.

The rebate is part of £37 billion of government support being targeted at those most in need to help with the cost of living. This includes at least £1,200 of extra support for millions of the most vulnerable households this year, with all domestic electricity customers receiving at least £400 towards their bills. An extra £144 million has also be given to councils to provide discretionary support to any household in financial need due to rising energy bills, including people on low incomes in council tax bands E to H.

Levelling Up Secretary Greg Clark said:


  The cost of living is at the forefront of everyone’s minds and the support the government has put in place is helping millions of households, especially those most in need, manage these pressures.



  We want to make sure everyone who is entitled to this cash receives it, so I urge people to check their bank accounts and speak to their council if they are yet to receive their £150 council tax rebate.


The rebate is available to most households living in council tax bands A to D on 1 April. This includes those who receive Local Council Tax Support, even if their council tax bill for the year is less than £150.

Anyone who thinks they are eligible but does not have a direct debit and has not received a payment or details of how to make a claim, should visit their local council’s website for more information.

Since announcing the rebate in April, the government has provided £28 million for councils to set up software and recruit staff and will top this up as necessary to cover all reasonable delivery costs. Councils have been given a host of options to make payments quickly and securely including bank account transfers, council tax account credits or a voucher-based system.

Local authorities must also make arrangements for those who cannot access the internet.

If households do not know who their local council is, they can find their website through entering their postcode at Find your local council.

"88",2022-07-22,"Over 7.2 million payments of £326 have already been made to help households through the government’s Cost of Living support.","
    
          7.2 million payments of £326 – worth a total of £2.4 billion – made in first week of Cost of Living support rollout
  Payments mark the first half of the £650 Cost of Living payment for low-income families, with the second half coming in the autumn
  Additional support for disabled people and pensioners will follow later this year
This means £2.4 billion has been paid out to low-income families in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, with the second instalment of £324 arriving later this year.

The first payments were made on 14 July 2022, meaning the government has paid on average over a million families every working day since then.

This is all part of the government’s £37 billion support package for households. Millions will get £1,200 this year to help them with rising costs, including this £650 payment, a £400 grant to help with energy bills, and a £150 Council Tax rebate for the 80% of households in bands A-D.

And in addition to this, nearly 1 in 10 people will get a £150 disability payment this autumn, while over eight million pensioner households could receive an extra £300 through their Winter Fuel Payments in November and December.

Work and Pensions Secretary, Thérèse Coffey said:


  This government said that we would protect those on the lowest incomes, and we have delivered what we said with over 7 million households receiving £326 in the last week. There is more help to come for households, with the second half of the £650 payment arriving later this year and further payments for pensioners and disabled people also on the way.


Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nadhim Zahawi said:


  I know that people are finding things difficult with rising prices and increasing pressure on household budgets.

  That’s why we’re taking action to control inflation and providing immediate help for households. It’s so important that over 7 million vulnerable households have received £326 direct payments so far and there is also more help to come, with 8 million of the most vulnerable households receiving £1,200 of direct support to help with bills over the winter.


In total, over eight million families will be eligible for this payment, with around one million eligible because they receive tax credits and no other eligible benefits. These families will receive their first instalment from HMRC in the autumn, and the second instalment in the winter.

DWP will administer payments for customers on all other eligible means-tested benefits, and no one needs to contact the government or apply for the payment at any stage.

Those who are eligible should look out in their bank accounts for a payment of £326 with the reference “DWP Cost of Living” in their bank accounts. This payment is made automatically, meaning no one has to apply or do anything to receive it.

Eligible claimants who have not received their payment yet should not be concerned, as the DWP expects some payments may take until 31 July 2022 to come through.

"89",2022-07-22,"New prison wings designed to get offenders clean will receive funding thanks to the government’s 10-year strategy to tackle drug-fuelled crime.","
    
          

£120 million to crack down on addiction and tackle drug-fuelled crime
  abstinence-led drug wings to be rolled out in prisons
  community drug testing boosted and extra support for prison leavers to prevent relapse


A £120 million drive, announced today (22 July 2022), will see the rollout of specialised wings across England and Wales which will treat drug addiction, including through abstinence, and then keep prisoners substance-free.

This tough approach will follow them through the prison gate, with offenders kept under closer control in the community with more drug testing, treatment and extra support to kick their addictions and keep our streets safer.

Ground-breaking new ‘problem-solving courts’ will also direct drug and alcohol abusers to tackle their addiction head-on or face tough consequences – including time in jail where necessary.

Illegal drug use costs the taxpayer nearly £22 billion each year, including NHS, prison and police costs.

Around half of all prisoners have a drug problem but those who get treatment are 19 percentage points less likely to reoffend.

Deputy Prime Minister, Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, Dominic Raab said:


  Drugs trap criminals in a destructive cycle of offending and prevents them from getting their lives back on track.

  Our plan will get offenders into rehab earlier, get them off all drugs permanently and support prisoners once they’re released into the community. That will drive down reoffending, and make our streets safer.


As a result of the funding announced today, up to 18 abstinence-led ‘drug recovery wings’ and 100 ‘incentivised substance-free living units’ (ISFL units) will be rolled out in prisons by 2025.

Currently, addicted prisoners willing to turn their lives around are supported to get off illicit drugs at one of 25 ISFL units, where they receive regular drug testing, peer support, and incentives such as extra gym time for good progress.

The new system will see heroin addicts and other opiate abusers then move to the new drug recovery wings for six months of further intensive treatment, if needed. Here addicts will be supported to get clean from all drugs, including substitutes like methadone, through abstinence – overseen by up to 50 new specialists who will work with prisons.

These abstinent prisoners will then transition back through the incentivised units and into the general prison population, with continued support to stay drug-free.

The £120 million funding will also improve the support offenders have access to once they leave prison, to give them the best chance of staying on the straight and narrow. This includes:

50 ‘health and justice partnership co-ordinators’, who will work between prisons, probation and treatment providers, to ensure offenders’ treatment plans transfer smoothly from prison to the community.
  Up to 50 more probation staff will oversee drug testing for criminals serving a community sentence to keep them clean.
  The launch of two problem-solving court pilots in Teesside and Liverpool to combat drug- and alcohol-fuelled crime by giving offenders in the community a choice to either address their issues and engage with the help offered or face swift reprisals.
  Birmingham Magistrates’ Court will also pilot a problem-solving court for female offenders with complex needs, including substance misuse.
Sean Oliver, HMP Oakwood’s Director, said:


  Abstinence can be key to get offenders off drugs and the start of turning their lives around.

  The dedicated drug recovery support in our prison is already helping us provide prisoners with the wraparound support to ensure they’re drug free when released.


Noreen Oliver, founder and managing director of Burton Addiction Centre, said:


  Drugs can have a devastating impact on families and communities. From the heartbroken parents asking a child to leave the family home, to the loved ones who sit and wait in fear for a knock on their door from police officers.

  We have to be more ambitious in helping those caught in the revolving door of drugs and crime, by recognising that a significant number of prisoners were not criminals before they became addicts.

  Making abstinence an integral part of the treatment system will give prisoners the chance and choice to live drug-free and crime-free lives and make our communities safer.


The funding is part of the government’s wider 10-year drugs plan which aims to tackle drugs and prevent crime, backed by nearly £900 million. This takes the government’s total investment on combating drugs over the next three years to £3 billion.

Notes to editors

Initiatives funded by the £120 million include:
    Rolling out up to 18 new drug recovery wings and boosting the number of incentivised substance-free living units from 25 to 100
      Piloting substance misuse problem-solving courts in the community to combat drug and alcohol-fuelled crime
      A new drug-testing contract in prisons and the community, meaning a larger number of tests can be undertaken.
      Up to 50 drug strategy leads in all male category C and women’s prisons. They will drive the development and delivery of drug recovery wings and ISFLs locally.
      50 health and justice partnership co-ordinators to cover all regions across England and Wales. These co-ordinators will liaise between prisons, probation, and local health partners so that prison leavers are supported to maintain and build on their progress towards abstinence.
      More laptops and licences so that prisoners can attend initial appointments with community treatment providers virtually prior to release
      The funding will also improve prison security measures such as anti-drone technology to tackle the supply of drugs into prisons and a new digital forensics laboratory to identify serious and organised criminals profiting from crime in prisons.
    
  A 2017 study found a 19 percentage-point reduction in the two-year rate of reoffending between those offenders who successfully completed drug or alcohol treatment and those who dropped out.

    Prime Minister Boris Johnson and David Buttress to host meeting of senior business leaders in No10 to discuss the new deals and what more can be done to support families
  
  
    Government cost of living advice website receives over 2.2 million visits, with 90% of users finding the site helpful
  


Retail deals and discounts to help families over the summer holidays have been announced as part of the government’s Help for Households Campaign.

Signed with some of the UK’s biggest businesses, including Asda, Morrisons, Amazon and Vodafone, these deals are designed to reduce costs at the checkout, help provide entertainment and ensure access to necessary services for families during the summer holidays and beyond.

Agreed with the government’s Cost of Living Business Tsar David Buttress, the deals include the extension of Asda’s ‘Kids eat for £1’ scheme, where children aged 16 and under can access a hot or cold meal for £1 at any time of day in Asda Cafes across the UK.

Sainsbury’s is introducing it’s ‘feed your family for a fiver’ campaign, helping customers with budget-friendly meal ideas to feed a family of four for less than £5.

Theatres in London are uniting for Kids Week, an initiative giving children the chance to see a West End show for free throughout August with a full paying adult, with half price tickets for two additional children in the same group, while Vodafone is promoting a mobile social tariff of £10 a month.

Along with new initiatives, some deals are a continuation of successful support schemes which businesses are already running and want to promote under the Help for Households campaign to raise awareness.

These include Amazon’s new ‘help for households’ page that will provide access to free entertainment such as Freevee and Amazon Music, as well as educational resources for school-aged children and low-price essential groceries. Morrisons is also providing a free meal for every child at in-store cafes when a parent buys an adult meal.

These deals form the first part of the Help for Household retail campaign which will aim to provide deals for families over four distinct periods –the summer holidays, back to school, Autumn pressures and Christmas retail – with deals secured and hosted on the government’s new Help for Households website so that people can find them easily in one place.

The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, said:


  We’re facing incredibly tough global economic headwinds and families across the country are feeling the pinch.

  That’s why this government is providing an unprecedent £37bn worth of support to help households through the storm.

  Both the public and private sector have a role to play here – and that’s why it’s great to see so many leading UK businesses are now coming forward to offer new deals and discounts that will provide much needed respite at the checkout.

  This won’t solve the issue overnight but it’s yet another weapon in our arsenal as we fight back against scourge of rising prices and inflation.


To mark the launch of the bespoke cost of living deals, the Prime Minister and David Buttress will host a meeting of senior business leaders involved in the campaign in No10 tomorrow [Thursday] to thank the businesses involved and discuss new ideas for cutting the cost of living.

Attendees are likely to include representatives from Sainsburys, Vodafone, Amazon, Centrica and the CBI.

Cost of Living Business Tsar David Buttress will also thank businesses for their support and praise the campaign’s “good start” while making clear that “we’ve got more to do and more deals to announce - not just over the summer holidays but when kids return to school and in the run up to Christmas when costs are typically higher”.

These deals build on the £37bn package of Help for Households already being provided by government – including tax cuts and help towards energy, childcare and transport costs.

The government’s online cost of living support pages, which have been visited over 2.2 million times, are helping the public to access the panoply of different cost of living support schemes available across government. 90% of users have said that they find the site helpful.

John Boumphrey, UK Country Manager, Amazon said:


  We are proud to be part of the Government’s ‘Help for Households’ campaign, as we continue to support our customers across the UK with great value and convenience.

  In fact, today we’ve launched a brand-new page on amazon.co.uk which shows you how to access free or discounted products and services from Amazon.

  This includes free entertainment for all, learning resources for students, along with more details of how else customers can save online.

  We will continue to offer the widest selection of products at the best possible prices, with many of these products sold by the 85,000 small and medium-sized UK businesses who use Amazon to reach customers here and around the world.


Simon Roberts, Chief Executive Officer at Sainsbury’s, said:


  The rising cost of living is at the forefront of customers’ minds, so we are delighted that our Feed your family for a fiver campaign is part of the initiative, helping people save money when it matters most.

  We have invested over half a billion pounds since March 2021 to ensure the items customers buy most often are on the shelves at the best prices. We are keeping inflation lower than our peers and we stand side by side with colleagues too – in April Sainsbury’s became the first major retailer to pay all our colleagues the Living Wage.


Hayley Tatum, Asda’s Chief Corporate Affairs and People Officer, said:


  Our latest Asda Income Tracker shows that families are on average £175 worse off per month compared to this time last year and many are finding it increasingly tough to make ends meet.

  We want to do all we can to support families during these tough times which is why we’re pleased to support the ‘Help for Households’ initiative and have today launched our Essential Living Hub where families can find hints and tips from a range of experts about how to make their budgets go further, including details of our Kids Eat for £1’ offer, which we’re pleased to confirm will be extended to all cafes across the UK until the end of the year.


Association of Convenience Stores Chief Executive, James Lowman, said:


  The UK’s 47,000 local shops play an incredibly important role in helping consumers to manage their money, save on fuel and other travel costs, and reduce food waste.

  We strongly welcome the new Help for Households campaign, and are committed to working with the cost of living tsar David Buttress to highlight how convenience stores are supporting both customers and colleagues during this challenging time for everyone.

  Many convenience store retailers are providing significant staff discounts and other benefits as part of extra support packages for colleagues in store, as well as doing everything they can to keep prices on the shelf in check despite rising costs in just about every area of their businesses.


Ahmed Essam, CEO at Vodafone UK, said:


  Vodafone is proud to support the ‘Help for Households’ campaign that raises awareness and offers support to individuals and families most impacted by the cost of living challenge. Vodafone offers VOXI For Now, which is the only mobile social tariff to help those experiencing financial hardship stay connected, as well as our everyone.connected campaign to provide free connectivity to one million people living in digital poverty by the end of 2022.

          Courts to make offenders face their addictions, in boost to public protection
  Sentences to include intense supervision and testing to support rehabilitation
  Strong sanctions, including jail time, if offenders transgress
The first three ‘Problem-Solving Courts’ (PSCs) are being piloted as part of the Government’s £900-million Drug Strategy, based on evidence that this approach will most effectively turn such offenders away from crime and protect the public.

They will trial a tougher approach to community sentences for low-level criminals who would otherwise face short jail terms.

Under unique orders which can be issued by the PSCs, offenders will see the same judge at least once a month, have intense support and supervision from the Probation Service, and get wraparound services tailored to their individual needs - such as from substance misuse and recovery agencies, housing support and educational services.

They will also get treatment and undertake frequent, random drug testing where appropriate. Offenders will be offered the full range of treatment interventions to help them achieve abstinence.

The £8.25-million pilot will see two such courts launched at Liverpool and Teesside Crown Courts, while a further one at Birmingham Magistrates’ Court will focus on female offenders with complex needs, including substance misuse.

Deputy Prime Minister, Justice Secretary and Lord Chancellor, Dominic Raab MP said:


  Getting criminal offenders sustainably off drugs is the gateway to getting them into work and a law-abiding future.



  Only once offenders are drug-free can they grasp the opportunities of skills training and employment and turn their backs on crime for good.



  So these innovative courts will help us grasp the nettle of drug addiction, and make our streets safer.


Judges and magistrates sitting in the PSCs will use incentives such as relaxing conditions to recognise good progress, as well as sanctions, such as increased drug testing and court reviews, when behaviour fails to meet agreed standards. They can also jail offenders for failure to stick to their sentence by imprisoning them for up to 28 days, up to a maximum of three times.

Maria (not her real name) was sentenced to an 18-month Suspended Sentence Order and requirement to attend the Greater Manchester Women’s PSC, a precursor to the new pilot for women who offend. She said:


  At first, I was worried about being judged, but it’s not like that – sentencers are supportive and want to keep you on the right path.



  You have to want to change. But after you’ve made that decision it’s incredibly hard to do it on your own and that’s why things like probation and the PSC are so important, to keep you from slipping back.


Notes to editors


    The Government committed in the Sentencing White Paper to pilot up to five PSCs and the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act Bill contained the necessary legislative provisions.  Two courts are still under consideration.
  
  
    More people die every year as a result of drug misuse than from all knife crime and road traffic accidents combined. The total cost to society and taxpayers in today’s prices is nearly £22 billion.
  
  
    The Government is committed to increasing treatment and reducing crime in its 10-year Drugs Strategy – From harm to hope - which is backed by an additional £900 million of funding for enforcement, treatment and recovery, taking the total investment on combating drugs over the next three years to £3 billion. The Strategy focuses on three key priorities - reducing demand for drugs, delivering a world-class treatment and recovery system and breaking drug supply chains. The strategy is contributing to the prevention of three-quarters of a million crimes including 140,000 ‘neighbourhood’ crimes like theft robbery and burglary.
  
  
    A PSC has been trialled in Greater Manchester focussed on female offenders and 14 Family Drug and Alcohol Courts (FDACs), alternative family court for care proceedings, have achieved success at reducing substance misuse. A Lancaster University study found:
  
  46% of FDAC mothers were no longer misusing substances by the end of proceedings, compared to 30% of comparison mothers, and
  
    37% of FDAC families were reunited or continued to live together compared to 25% of comparison families
  
  
    Teesside and Merseyside have high levels of need. In 2020, the North East had the highest rate of deaths relating to drug misuse across England and Wales (104.6 deaths per million people) compared to the national rate of 52.3 deaths per million people, while the rate of deaths relating to drug misuse in the North West is 74.2 per million. A 2019 study by the Prison Reform Trust showed that rates of immediate custody per 100,000 women in the West Midlands (36 per 100,000) were higher than the overall rate for England and Wales.
  
  Previous impact evaluations have found that community sentences are effective in addressing offending behaviour.

  At first, I was worried about being judged, but it’s not like that – sentencers are supportive and want to keep you on the right path.



  You have to want to change. But after you’ve made that decision it’s incredibly hard to do it on your own and that’s why things like probation and the PSC are so important, to keep you from slipping back.


Notes to editors


    The Government committed in the Sentencing White Paper to pilot up to five PSCs and the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act Bill contained the necessary legislative provisions.  Two courts are still under consideration.
  
  
    More people die every year as a result of drug misuse than from all knife crime and road traffic accidents combined. The total cost to society and taxpayers in today’s prices is nearly £22 billion.
  
  
    The Government is committed to increasing treatment and reducing crime in its 10-year Drugs Strategy – From harm to hope - which is backed by an additional £900 million of funding for enforcement, treatment and recovery, taking the total investment on combating drugs over the next three years to £3 billion. The Strategy focuses on three key priorities - reducing demand for drugs, delivering a world-class treatment and recovery system and breaking drug supply chains. The strategy is contributing to the prevention of three-quarters of a million crimes including 140,000 ‘neighbourhood’ crimes like theft robbery and burglary.
  
  
    A PSC has been trialled in Greater Manchester focussed on female offenders and 14 Family Drug and Alcohol Courts (FDACs), alternative family court for care proceedings, have achieved success at reducing substance misuse. A Lancaster University study found:
  
  46% of FDAC mothers were no longer misusing substances by the end of proceedings, compared to 30% of comparison mothers, and
  
    37% of FDAC families were reunited or continued to live together compared to 25% of comparison families
  
  
    Teesside and Merseyside have high levels of need. In 2020, the North East had the highest rate of deaths relating to drug misuse across England and Wales (104.6 deaths per million people) compared to the national rate of 52.3 deaths per million people, while the rate of deaths relating to drug misuse in the North West is 74.2 per million. A 2019 study by the Prison Reform Trust showed that rates of immediate custody per 100,000 women in the West Midlands (36 per 100,000) were higher than the overall rate for England and Wales.
  
  Previous impact evaluations have found that community sentences are effective in addressing offending behaviour.

"93",2022-07-14,"Almost one in four families across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will get £326 sent directly to them from today, with the second instalment of £324 sent later this year as part of the government’s £37 billion support package.","
    
          £326 – the first of two cost of living payments – will automatically hit seven million bank accounts between today and 31 July 2022 as part of the government’s £37 billion support package
  Second instalment of £324 will follow from the autumn, with separate payments for pensioners and disabled people also coming later this year
  Tax credit claimants will receive their first cost of living instalment by autumn
Over eight million households on means-tested benefits will automatically get the first instalment of £326 from this month.

This means that, combined with other support, millions of low-income households across the UK will receive at least £1,200 from the government by Christmas to ease Cost of Living pressures.

On top of that, nearly one in ten people will get the £150 disability payment this Autumn, and over 8 million pensioner households could get an extra £300 from Winter Fuel Payments in November and December.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:


  Just as we looked after people during lockdown, we will help them get through these tough economic times.

  Today’s payment is the signal to millions of families that we are on their side and we have already promised more cash in the autumn, alongside other measures – including our Help for Households – to support the vulnerable and ease the burden.


Work and Pensions Secretary, Thérèse Coffey said:


  Our help for households will begin landing in bank accounts today as we make sure those on the lowest incomes get the support they need in the face of rising costs.

  This first instalment of £326 should reach all eligible low-income households by the end of July.


Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nadhim Zahawi said:


  It’s great that millions of the families who are most in need are starting to receive their Cost of Living Payments, which I know will be a massive help for people who are struggling.

  Alongside tax cuts, changes to Universal Credit and the Household Support Fund, these payments are a vital part of our £37 billion support package to help people deal with rising prices.


Most people entitled to the first instalment of our Cost of Living payment will receive it between now and 31 July 2022. Households who are eligible because they receive tax credits and no other eligible benefits will receive their first instalment from HMRC in the autumn, and the second instalment in the winter. DWP will administer payments for customers on all other eligible means-tested benefits, and customers do not need to contact the government or apply for the payment at any stage.

In addition to the £650 Cost of Living Payment, all domestic energy customers in the UK will receive a £400 grant to help with energy bills, and those in Council Tax bands A-D in England will get an extra £150, which has already been sent to many households. This brings support for millions to £1,200 by the end of the year.

The disability and pensioner payments come in addition to this, as does any support from the Household Support Fund, which was recently extended through to March 2023 with £421 million additional funding. It is now worth £1.263 billion, and combined with £237 million for devolved nations, means this support package now stands at £1.5 billion. The Household Support Fund is designed to help low-income households in England with food and energy bills, and is distributed by local authorities, who know their areas best.

Total government support this year for low-income families stands at £37 billion, a figure which includes a recent rise to £12,570 for the National Insurance starting thresholds. This will benefit 30 million working people and is worth £330 to a typical employee.

"94",2022-07-14,"On Tuesday 12 July, senior Cabinet Ministers awarded young people and employers for their contribution to tackling high youth unemployment through the Kickstart Scheme, as the country recovered from the pandemic.","
    
          Launched in September 2020, the scheme secured over 163,000 jobs for young people nationwide as part of the government’s drive to help those aged 16-24 start their career and gain vital work experience.

At an awards ceremony in Lancaster House on Tuesday 12 July, six young people were awarded for their outstanding contribution as recognised by their employer, while 16 employers were recognised for their work in supporting young people out of the pandemic.

The Kickstart Awards come as the latest data shows that 7 out of 10 young people had earnings four months after their Kickstart job ended, showing its success in providing young people with the right skills to enter the labour market.

Unemployment is now at an almost 50 year low, and when the Kickstart Scheme ended in March, youth unemployment was the lowest since records began.

Recipients of the awards included a young woman from Surrey who worked in a women’s support centre supporting victims of domestic abuse, and a young Scottish man trained by his employer in AI development.

Some of the roles on offer by shortlisted employers included film making, archaeology, landscape architecture, animal sanctuary support and hospitality.

Kickstart provided a crucial lifeline to businesses, with many keeping young people on in permanent roles, including through apprenticeships. And many of these businesses have continued to work with their local jobcentres through the Way to Work scheme, which saw half a million more people move into work in five months earlier this year.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:


  Our Kickstart Scheme has transformed the lives of thousands of young people, giving them their vital first step into the workplace and the confidence to develop skills, while businesses have benefitted from fresh talent, energy and enthusiasm.

  I want to congratulate all those who have made a success of this fantastic programme, with many still in work today, and I want to thank all the employers who joined us on our mission to invest in the next generation and help ensure unemployment stays at its near 50 year low.



Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Thérèse Coffey said:


  Kickstart has been a huge success for our young people with over 163,000 of them having a first taste of work after a challenging time in the pandemic. With around 30,000 still on the scheme, most Kickstart graduates are still in work, which is fantastic news. I’d like to thank every business that worked with us to create opportunities and improve the prospects of a generation of talent.


Looking ahead, ministers have renewed their focus on supporting those with additional barriers get into work, so that everyone, no matter their age or career stage, has access to a stable and rewarding career, utilising the national network of jobcentres.

People are now being supported by their jobcentre to progress, helping them to earn more money, get more hours, and use their experience as a springboard for their career, while boosting economic growth to address the cost of living.

"95",2022-07-13,"Claims for Pension Credit more than doubled during the Department for Work and Pension’s recent Pension Credit Day of Action, new figures have revealed.","
    
          Over 10,000 Pension Credit claims were made during the week of 13 June – an increase of 275% compared to that same week in 2021.

The two-step in the right direction was helped by Strictly Come Dancing’s Len Goodman, who teamed up with Minister for Pensions Guy Opperman to help spread the message. The pair’s social media video encouraging Pension Credit claims has now been viewed over 1.3 million times.

The boost means even more pensioners could be in line to receive extra financial support worth an average of over £3,300 a year.

Minister for Pensions Guy Opperman said:


  We recognise the challenges some pensioners will be facing with the cost of living which is why promoting Pension Credit is a priority.

  The success of our Day of Action means more pensioners can get the support they’re entitled to, but we’re not stopping there. We’re continuing to get the word out about Pension Credit, calling on everyone with retired family, friends and loved ones to check in with them and see if they can get this extra financial support, which can make a huge difference to people’s lives.


The Day of Action also saw charities, stakeholders, broadcasters and a whole range of partners getting involved to encourage people to claim.

Pension Credit is designed to help with daily living costs for people over State Pension age and on a low income, though you do not need to be in receipt of State Pension to receive it.

It tops up a person’s income to a minimum of £182.60 per week for single pensioners and to £278.70 for couples.

Currently, over 1.4 million pensioners in Britain receive Pension Credit. However, many are still not claiming this extra financial help.

Rich Mackenzie, DWP Visiting Officer, said:


  Many people who could claim Pension Credit aren’t.

  I would appeal to anyone who comes into contact with pensioners to ask how much they know about Pension Credit. It could be something that helps, and in the current financial climate, there’s no doubt that more people will experience hardship.

  Pension Credit won’t solve every problem, but it will go a long way to alleviating difficulties. It should be a collective endeavour for us all.


Even a small Pension Credit award can provide access to a wide range of other benefits – such as help with housing costs, council tax or heating bills. For those over 75, this includes continued entitlement to a free TV licence.

Pension Credit can be claimed by phone and online, ensuring that older people can apply safely and easily, wherever they are. The online Pension Credit calculator is also on hand to help pensioners check if they’re likely to be eligible and get an estimate of what they may receive.

"96",2022-07-09,"Parents who refuse to pay child maintenance could face curfews, as Ministers plan new powers for the Child Maintenance Service.","
    
          The change is being considered as part of fresh proposals that will get more of the money that is owed to the children of separated parents.

The Child Maintenance Service (CMS) collected or arranged £1 billion in child maintenance payments last year, operating as a crucial weapon in the battle against child poverty. Child support payments help lift around 140,000 children out of poverty each year.

Curfew orders would be another method of enforcement, alongside current powers which include passport and driving license confiscation and earnings deduction orders, to tackle parents who continually refuse to pay maintenance owed.

As an alternative sanction to prison, which is costly and prevents maintenance getting to children, curfews would act as a deterrent by restricting and disrupting non-compliant parents’ lifestyles, stopping them, for example, from going out for dinner, to the pub or going on holiday.

The curfews would be monitored by an electronic tag with an electronic monitoring service applying the tag, monitoring and making sure the parent complies with the rules of the tag. If parents fail to comply, the CMS would be able refer them back to court which might then extend the curfew order or impose a prison sentence.

DWP Lords Minister Baroness Stedman-Scott said:


  For children in low-income households, maintenance payments can make all the difference, lifting them out of poverty.

  We are not afraid to go after those parents who deliberately and repeatedly refuse to pay for their children.

  Curfew orders are another step towards providing the CMS with a full arsenal of powers to make sure children get the financial support they need to have the best start in life.


This builds on new powers introduced earlier this year to digitise all communications to parents and improvements to help the service trace the paying parent, calculate maintenance and enforce arrears more effectively.

The Child Maintenance consultation is published on Gov UK and closes on 12 August 2022.

"97",2022-07-08,"People worried about the cost of living or their debt payment plans are being urged to speak with their trustees, insolvency practitioners, or a debt adviser.","
    
          
The government understands that people are worried about the impact of rising prices and its effect on household incomes.

The government’s MoneyHelper has lots of free information and resources to help you manage your money in uncertain times and how to keep up with essential bills and payments.

If you are worried about debt, speaking to a trained and experienced debt adviser about your situation could help you decide what to do.

And if you are concerned about missing a payment towards your Individual Voluntary Arrangement, Income Payments Agreement or Income Payments Order having early conversations is the best first step to resolving your money issues and avoiding missing payments.

Individual Voluntary Arrangements (IVA)

If you are in an IVA, you can ask your supervisor to review your income and expenses to see if you are eligible for a reduction in payments or payment break.

You will be required to provide evidence of your income and expenditure to support a change to your contributions. This could include providing payslips, statement of benefits or utility bills.

Any amendments to your contributions into your IVAs would need to be agreed with your creditors.

Your supervisor has been provided with the latest guidance on adjustments to payments, via the IVA Standing Committee, and they will also be aware of alternative solutions to help you resolve your debt issues and can help you find further information where appropriate.

Income Payments Agreements and Income Payments Orders

If you have an Income Payments Agreement or Income Payments Order, you can ask for a review of your income and expenses to see if you are eligible for a reduction in payments, or payment break.

The spending guidelines have been updated for inflation in the current financial climate and if you feel you need a review, you should contact the organisation you make payments to.

"98",2022-06-30,"Half a million people have been supported into work in less than 6 months thanks to “Way to Work”, a government drive to get jobseekers into vacancies.","
    
          Over 500,000 jobseekers have been supported to find work through their jobcentre as government meets its target, helping to grow the economy
  Benefit claimants moved into work at a record rate in April 2022 as part of the “Way to Work” drive
  Hundreds of employers across the UK benefit, saving money on recruitment costs and filling vacancies fast
Launched in January, ministers set the target of supporting 500,000 jobseekers through the jobcentre and into employment by the end of June. This coincided with the need to fill a record number of job vacancies as the economy rebounded after the pandemic.

Unemployment now stands at an almost 50 year low with 627,000 more people in payroll employment compared to pre-pandemic levels.

The nation’s attitudes have been transformed, with many jobseekers taking on roles in new sectors and employers recruiting through jobcentres for the first time. To keep up momentum, the department will continue to bring jobseekers face to face with employers, helping more people find work and earn a wage.

Prime Minister, Boris Johnson said:


  In less than six months we’ve helped half a million people - who have so far been struggling to find employment - into work. This is a massive success, especially in the context of some of the global economic pressures we’ve been facing.

  Helping people find the security of a stable income, through a job they can take pride in, is one of the best ways for people to support their families during these challenging times.

  That’s why we’re stepping up targeted support measures to ensure everyone can find a job that’s right for them, develop their skills and climb up the career ladder.


Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Thérèse Coffey said:


  When people needed jobs and the economy needed workers, we stepped up our efforts to connect jobseekers with employers and have delivered on our target to get 500,000 more people into work in less than six months.

  Our ABC approach to help people get Any job first, a Better job next and into a Career is off to a flying start. With people in jobs, we can move to the next stage – helping them progress in-work and boost their earnings.


Minister for Employment, Mims Davies MP said:


  After this huge success, we’re determined to get everyone, at any age or career stage, the support they need to get back into work.

  We’re stepping up our targeted support for older workers, those living with health conditions and for people who have been out of work for more than 12 months, ensuring everyone can find a job that’s right for them, earn a wage and have the opportunity to progress.

  As part of “Way to Work”, rules for job-ready claimants were changed, requiring them to broaden their job search after one month to include sectors new to them.


The Department for Work and Pensions also worked with employers to short-circuit their recruitment practices, getting hiring managers and jobseekers in front of each other in jobcentres across the UK, leading to an ‘on the spot’ hiring approach, getting people earning quicker, and reducing hiring costs for employers.

Following the success of the jobs drive, ministers have renewed a focus on supporting in-work progression for workers across the country through the national network of jobcentres.

Having picked up the roles that the economy needed, people are now being supported by their jobcentre to progress, helping them to earn more money, get more hours, and use their experience as a springboard for their career.

In addition, the Department for Work and Pensions is focused on supporting the long-term unemployed, older workers and those with health conditions to find work, helping the UK maximise employment and supporting economic growth.

Midlife MOT’s will help older workers take stock of their skills and finances, and take advantage of those years in work over 50, which we know can often be the most interesting and lucrative.

In addition, ministers have committed to spending £1.3 billion to support people with disability and health challenges into work, building on the expansion of Disability Employment Advisers.

And because returning to work can be more difficult after an extended period of unemployment, the government’s Restart Scheme will give jobseekers a year of intensive support to help get them back on the job ladder, and is already supporting a quarter of a million back into work.

"99",2022-06-27,"Broadband and mobile firms commit to do more to help customers cope with global price rises
","
    
          
Customers who can no longer afford their bills will be offered help to stay connected
  Digital Secretary urges anyone struggling to speak to their provider following No 10 summit co-chaired by cost-of-living tsar David Buttress
The UK’s biggest broadband and mobile operators have agreed to a raft of new commitments to further help customers with the rising cost of living following a government-led summit at No 10 Downing Street.

These include measures such as allowing customers struggling with bills to move to cheaper packages without charge or penalty, or agreeing manageable payment plans, and options to improve existing low cost offers and increasing promotion of existing deals.

The measures, put forward by the government in consultation with the industry, will ensure people struggling with bills due to the economic aftermath of the pandemic and war in Ukraine can continue to make calls, send texts and get online.

Bosses representing the vast majority of the UK telecoms market - including BT Group, Openreach, Virgin Media O2, Vodafone, Three, TalkTalk and Sky - signed up to the pledges at an event chaired by Digital Secretary Nadine Dorries and Cost of Living Business Tsar David Buttress today.

The commitments, which take effect immediately, are:


    All providers commit to supporting their customers who may be struggling with the cost-of-living and to treat them with compassion, understanding and as individuals.
  
  
    All providers commit to supporting customers struggling with their bills and to offer ways to keep them connected, such as allowing them to move to cheaper packages without charge or penalty, or agreeing manageable payment plans.
  
  
    All operators commit to continue to protect the connectivity of their customers known to be vulnerable as a priority.
  
  
    Providers - supported by Government - commit to take steps to raise awareness of low cost products to those claiming Universal Credit.
  
  
    Mobile providers commit to considering more ways to help their customers, including exploring tariffs, options to improve existing low cost offers, and increasing promotion of existing deals.
  
The government has already taken action to help those on benefits access cheaper deals by negotiating social tariffs for those on Universal Credit which are now available across 99 per cent of the UK, but this latest intervention means anyone struggling to pay their broadband or mobile bill as a result of global price rises can expect support from their provider if they ask for it.

Digital Secretary Nadine Dorries said:


  Families across the country face increased anxiety about keeping up with bills, so today I agreed with broadband and mobile industry bosses what more can be done to support people during this difficult time.

  I’m pleased to report the industry is listening and has signed up to new commitments offering customers struggling with the cost of living help to stay connected. Those who need support should contact their supplier to see what is available.


Commenting on the meeting, Chief Executive at Mobile UK, Hamish MacLeod, said:


  Mobile operators welcome the commitments agreed upon today with the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport, which build on offers already in place to help the most vulnerable. We welcomed the chance to discuss with the Government not only how to raise awareness of such schemes but also to set out the further steps being taken to support those struggling with their bills.


Andrew Glover, Chair of the Internet Service Providers’ Association, said:


  The telecoms sector knows that people are facing real challenges with the cost-of-living crisis. Our members are determined to do what they can to help their customers through this period and, together with government, we will work to raise greater awareness of the support available.

  These commitments, along with the social tariffs that are available from many members, will hopefully help people in need at this challenging time. We encourage customers who are struggling with their bills to reach out to their broadband provider to get help.


The Digital Secretary has been calling on all providers yet to offer social tariffs - discounted broadband and mobile deals for people on Universal Credit and other benefits - to step up and support their customers. She has called on broadband providers that do offer social tariffs to do more to raise awareness of them, after Ofcom data showed less than two per cent of eligible people are taking up these discounted offers.

In a letter sent in April to the bosses of BT Group, Virgin Media O2, Hyperoptic, KCom, G.Network and Community Fibre, she asked for an outline of their plans to promote social tariffs and for estimates of take-up over the coming twelve months. These companies all offer social tariff products to low-income households, with some providers offering deals from as low as £10 per month. Vodafone - via its Voxi brand - recently launched the first mobile social tariff.

Social tariff offers are available to eligible people in 99 per cent of the country and could represent a saving of more than 50 per cent (around £180 per year) against the average cost of broadband.

Landline and broadband social tariffs have been offered by BT, Virgin Media O2 and KCom for several years, but since 2021 there has been a threefold rise in companies voluntarily offering their own social tariffs - with Sky, Now Broadband, County Broadband and others coming forward - after the government stepped in to negotiate the low-cost deals.

"100",2022-06-22,"Over 8 million households in the UK will get a cash payment from July 2022 to ease cost of living pressures.","
    
          Over 8 million households will receive the first of two cost of living instalments totalling £650 from 14 July 2022, part of the £1,200 support package this year
  Initial automatic instalment for means-tested benefit claimants will be £326, with the rest to follow in a second instalment from the autumn
  Tax credit claimants will also receive their first instalment of the cost of living payment from HMRC later this year
  Comes as part of £37 billion government package to help families with cost of living pressures
After ministers confirmed initial payments would begin from 14 July 2022, the Department for Work and Pensions has now revealed how many people in each part of the country will receive the new financial support. They have also revealed that the disability top-up will land in bank accounts in September 2022.

These figures show that nearly one in four families will receive the means-tested benefit cost of living payment, whilst nearly one in ten of the population will get the £150 disability top-up.

The first cost of living instalment will see millions of low-income households in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland initially £326 better off as the government delivers significant interventions to support groups who are most vulnerable to rising costs. In total, millions of households will receive at least £1,200 from the government this year to help cover rising costs.

Work and Pensions Secretary, Thérèse Coffey said:


  With millions of the lowest-income households soon seeing the first of two cash instalments land into their bank accounts, we are taking action to directly help families with the cost of living.



  This one-off payment totalling £650 is part of our £37 billion cost of living support package that will put an extra £1,200 into the pockets of those most in need.


The second instalment of £324 will be sent to qualifying low income households from the Autumn. The payments are designed to be deliberately slightly unequal to minimise fraud risks from those who may seek to exploit this system.

The eligibility date for the second instalment will be announced soon. If customers are eligible through receiving tax credits only, HMRC will contact them and issue payments automatically, with the first instalment being made from autumn. DWP will administer payments for customers on all other eligible means-tested benefits, and customers do not need to contact them or apply for the payment.

Low-income households are benefiting from government support in a variety of different ways this year as global inflationary pressures, exacerbated by the unjust war in Ukraine, have caused prices to rise for several essentials. The government understands that many people are worried about the impact these rising prices will have on their household finances, which is why £37 billion of support is being provided to boost budgets and mitigate the worst of these pressures.

Support includes the direct cost of living payment of up to £650 for over 8 million households on eligible means-tested benefits, a separate £300 payment for pensioners, and a £150 payment for eligible disabled people, which can be paid on top of the £650 payment.

This is on top of £400 for all households to help with energy bills, and an extra £150 for properties in Council Tax bands A-D, meaning millions of the lowest-income households will receive at least £1,200 in support this year. This is all in addition to changes to the Universal Credit taper rate and work allowances worth £1,000 a year on average for 1.7 million working claimants, a rise in the National Living Wage to £9.50 an hour, and a tax cut for around 30 million workers through a rise in National Insurance contribution thresholds.

The government has also expanded support for the Household Support Fund – which helps people with food and energy bills – with an extra £421 million, on top of £79 million for devolved nations; the total value of this support now stands at £1.5 billion. Fuel duty was also cut by 5p per litre for 12 months in March, and alcohol duty has been frozen for 2022/23.

"101",2022-06-16,"The Environment Agency has completed additional flood defence work in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, to alleviate issues around the A38 at Branston.","
    
          The work, which started last summer in 2021, reduces flood risk to some 397 properties, including 18 affected by the flood of February 2020.  The whole investment in Burton, including £2 million from the National Highways Designated Funds programme, has cost over £30 million, and reduces the risk of flooding to over 4,600 homes and 1,000 businesses.

The A38 at Branston and adjacent properties have experienced flooding on several occasions since 2000. An investigation revealed that when the level of the River Trent was high, water got into Severn Trent Water’s foul sewerage system, highway drains and through low ground and eventually flooded properties and the highway.

Through the construction of sheet piled walls, embankments and non-return valves, water will now be contained in Tatenhill Brook when the River Trent is high.

Will Groves, Senior Flood Risk Adviser for the Environment Agency, said:


  This latest completed work has been funded from the £30 million set aside to improve the flood defences in the Burton-upon-Trent area.

  We want to thank all members of the local community for their understanding and patience while these works have taken place.

  Our team first started construction work in Burton in 2019 and the improved flood defences have already successfully protected properties, which otherwise would have been affected by floods, in the last two years.

  While these defences should provide reassurance to communities and businesses, no one should have a false sense of security. We strongly urge people to sign up for flood warnings and regularly check flood risk via our website


Ian Doust, National Highways Programme Development Manager, said:


  We are committed to reducing flooding on our roads and also minimising flood risks to the communities who live alongside them.

  In response to the changing climate, we are investing in schemes such as this which will improve the flood resilience of our network and reduce the flooding risk to our neighbours.

  It is extremely rewarding to see the completion of this scheme which will not only protect our roads and people living alongside them for generations to come but in the future will also enhance the waterside habitats enabling wildlife to thrive.

          Currently, over 1.4 million pensioners in Britain receive Pension Credit. However, many are still not claiming this extra financial help that can be worth over £3,300 a year.

It comes as the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) today held its second annual Pension Credit Day of Action as part of a new advertising campaign.

DWP will also be providing leaflets for local communities, while businesses can also get involved in the campaign by spreading the word to their customers using the department’s digital toolkit and encouraging them to call the claim line between the hours of 8am to 6pm.

All State Pension recipients will continue to receive reminders about Pension Credit in the post as part of the department’s annual uprating communications.

Minister for Pensions Guy Opperman said: 


  We recognise the challenges some pensioners will be facing with the cost of living which is why promoting Pension Credit is a priority.

  We’re calling on everyone with retired family, friends and loved ones to check in with them and see if they can get this extra financial support, which could make a huge difference to people’s everyday lives.


Martin Lewis, founder and chair of MoneySavingExpert.com, said:


  Amidst the cost of living crisis, it’s a national tragedy that getting on for a million pensioners are missing out on a major income boost. My simple rule of thumb is if you (or someone you know) are aged 66 or older, and have total income of under roughly £200 a week, get online or call the Pension Credit claim line to see if you’re due a payment that can be as much as £3,300 a year. I’m not saying everyone will get it, but many will, and it only takes a few minutes to find out. So don’t stall, just call.

  And not only is this serious money, it’s also often a gateway entitlement that means you’re due a range of other support, such as council tax reductions, the £650 extra energy funding help, warm home discount, housing benefit, dental and optical treatments and, for the over-75s, a free TV licence. So again, don’t stall, just call!


Rich Mackenzie, DWP Visiting Officer, said:


  Many people who could claim Pension Credit aren’t.

  I would appeal to anyone who comes into contact with pensioners to ask how much they know about Pension Credit. It could be something that helps, and in the current financial climate, there’s no doubt that more people will experience hardship.

  Pension Credit won’t solve every problem, but it will go a long way to alleviating difficulties. It should be a collective endeavour for us all.



Dame Clare Moriarty, Chief Executive of Citizens Advice, said:


  At a time when millions of people are struggling with the rising cost of living, it’s more important than ever that people are getting the support they’re entitled to.

  Pension Credit can be a really important boost for older people who are struggling with a low income. Citizens Advice can help you to understand if you might be eligible and advise you on how to make a claim.


The campaign also includes tackling some of the myths that may stop people applying, such as how having savings, a pension or owning a home are not necessarily barriers to receiving Pension Credit.

It also reminds people that even a small award can provide access to a wide range of other benefits – such as help with housing costs, council tax or heating bills. For those over 75, this includes continued entitlement to a free TV licence.

Pension Credit can be claimed by phone and online, ensuring that older people can apply safely and easily, wherever they are. The online Pension Credit calculator is also on hand to help pensioners check if they’re likely to be eligible and get an estimate of what they may receive.

Pension Credit is designed to help with daily living costs for people over State Pension age and on a low income, though you do not need to be in receipt of State Pension to receive it.

It tops up a person’s income to a minimum of £182.60 per week for single pensioners and to £278.70 for couples.

The first instalment of the £650 for qualifying low income households in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will land in bank accounts from 14 July 2022, continuing to the end of the month.

The move will see millions of households initially £326 better off as the government delivers significant interventions to support groups who are most vulnerable to rising costs. In total, millions of households will receive at least £1,200 from the government this year to help cover rising costs.

Work and Pensions Secretary, Thérèse Coffey said:

David Buttress, former chief executive of Just Eat, has been appointed as the Government’s new Cost of Living Business Tsar by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.

Mr Buttress will work in partnership with the private sector to identify, develop and promote new and existing business-led initiatives that support people with rising costs of living – from discounted prices or product offers to the expansion of business-run programmes.

This work will build on the schemes, offers and targeted help that some businesses and organisations are already providing and help raise awareness of the private sector offer to the public, which is in addition to extensive government-funded support. Successful examples include price locking campaigns seen in retailers Asda, Sainsbury’s and Boots, and energy supplier Octopus’s decision to double its hardship support fund, which has helped more than 36,000 people so far.  

The Holiday Activities and Food Programme provides one such opportunity for local level partnerships between sports clubs and supermarkets, backing projects that boost access to free activities and food during the holidays for disadvantaged children, including those in receipt of free school meals.

Mr Buttress will join today (Tuesday 14 June) a roundtable with supermarkets and sports organisations hosted by the Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi, where they will discuss the role that the private sector can play in helping low-income families, including through the Government’s Holiday Activities and Food Programme. 

Representatives from organisations such as Co-op, John Lewis Partnership/Waitrose, Swim England, Sport England, and English Football League are due to attend.

Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Steve Barclay said:

“Businesses and organisations across the country have stepped up time and time again when the nation needs it most. The financial pressures people are facing as a result of current global challenges will be no different.

“I am delighted to have David Buttress on board, bringing with him a wealth of experience along with the vigour and ingenuity of business to go even further in efforts to support British families throughout this difficult time.”

David Buttress has a wealth of experience in entrepreneurship and investment – leading Just Eat in the UK from a start-up to becoming Europe’s largest technology IPO in a decade. He is currently Chairman of Dragons Rugby club in Newport and a Venture Partner at 83North Venture Capital.

David Buttress, Cost of Living Business Tsar, said:

“The rising cost of living that we are all facing, both in the UK and globally, provides business and industry with a unique challenge and opportunity to do our bit.

“I am looking forward to working closely with my private sector colleagues, to help support our communities and customers with practical and real cost of living saving initiatives.”

The new role of Cost of Living Business Tsar is the latest strand of Government action to support people with challenging financial pressures.

Last month, the Government announced that eight million of the most vulnerable households (around a third of all UK households) will receive £1,200 this year and all families will receive £400 – this is on top of changes to Universal Credit, National Living Wage and National Insurance thresholds, so that people keep more of what they earn.

This takes total government cost of living support to over £37 billion – higher than other major economies around the world.

The Government has recently launched a new website which brings government support on offer together in one place so the public can see what support they could be eligible for: www.gov.uk/costoflivingsupport

David Buttress will work in this role until the end of the year and is a voluntary (unpaid) role.

          UK Work and Pensions Secretary, Thérèse Coffey, chairs first OECD Ministerial meeting on employment and labour markets since 2016
  Ministers from all 38 countries agree to ambitious pledge to focus on sustainability, equality and young people
  Members condemn Russian aggression, whose participation with the OECD was suspended in March this year
Supporting careers for young people was at the heart of the agreement adopted by ministers from all OECD countries, as part of their commitment to create more diverse, sustainable, and robust labour markets.

Led by UK Work and Pensions Secretary, Thérèse Coffey, the discussion focused on the impacts of the pandemic as well as recent challenges, such as the rise in the cost of living triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The UK minister addressed her counterparts with insight into the UK’s successful experience of building a strong labour market post-pandemic. Latest data shows the UK currently has a national unemployment rate of 3.7% – the lowest since 1974 with over a million more disabled people in work since 2017.

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Thérèse Coffey said:


  The importance of focusing on decent, sustainable and high-quality work for all was shared by international ministers around the table today, along with a commitment to promote life-long learning and build inclusivity in our workforce.



  As we move on from the pandemic, and face common issues in our labour markets, we must continue to work together to find united solutions and build a fairer and greener global economy.


Delegates also condemned the ongoing Russian aggression, as countries stood in solidarity with Ukraine, after a decision was taken to suspend Russia’s participation in OECD activity in March 2022.

Last year, the UK’s G7 Presidency made it a priority to get people back into quality and more sustainable jobs and invest in skills to boost economic recovery.

Today’s Employment and Labour Ministerial, which was held with an official theme of looking beyond the COVID-19 crisis to a better labour market that works for all, reflected the UK’s ongoing commitment to building a strong and inclusive labour market, including working internationally to tackle gender pay gaps.

Ministers also agreed to put environmental challenges at the heart of their plans, and support workers to transition to sustainable sectors, aligning with a key ambition set out by the UK Prime Minister at the COP26 Climate Change summit in Glasgow to create millions of green jobs by unlocking both public and private sector cash.

"106",2022-05-30,"The CMA has found that Cérélia’s purchase of the Jus-Rol business could lead to higher prices and lower quality products for shoppers in the UK.","
    
          Cérélia is the largest manufacturer of bake-at-home dough products in the UK, producing private label (own brand) products on behalf of some of the largest grocery retailers in the UK.  Jus-Rol is the best-selling brand in the bake-at-home dough category and faces few branded rivals.

Some of Jus-Rol’s popular products include puff and shortcrust pastry dough, pizza dough and pain au chocolat dough.

Together, the businesses are the 2 leading suppliers of bake-at-home products to supermarkets and other grocery retailers and account for over two-thirds of sales of such products to shoppers in the UK. The Competition and Market Authority’s (CMA)  investigation has found that, prior to the merger, Jus-Rol’s branded products competed against private label products supplied by Cérélia for space on supermarket shelves.

Following the deal, Cérélia would produce and sell both the Jus-Rol products and private label products, leaving retailers with fewer alternatives. The CMA is therefore concerned that the loss of the Jus-Rol business as an independent player could lead to increased prices to grocery retailers – and ultimately consumers – and lower quality products.

Sorcha O’Carroll, Senior Director of Mergers said:


  Millions of people across the UK regularly use bake-at-home dough products, whether to rustle up a mid-week pizza for dinner or to make breakfast pastries for their families on the weekend.

  Consumers should know they’re getting value for money and not overpaying for their grocery products, especially as the current cost-of-living crisis stretches people’s budget even further. That’s why we won’t hesitate to refer this investigation further if our concerns aren’t addressed.


Cérélia now has 5 working days to submit proposals to address the CMA’s concerns. If suitable proposals are not submitted, the CMA will progress to an in-depth Phase 2 investigation.

For more information, visit the Cérélia / Jus-Rol merger inquiry page.

Notes to editors

All media enquiries should be directed to the CMA press office by email on press@cma.gov.uk, or by phone on 020 3738 6460.
  Cérélia refers to Cérélia Group Holding SAS (either directly or through entities under its common ownership or common control or over which it exerts material influence within the meaning of section 26 of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act).
  The CMA believes that the merger gives rise to a realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition as a result of horizontal unilateral effects in the wholesale supply of bake-at-home dough products to grocery retailers in the UK.
  Under the Act the CMA has a duty to make a reference to Phase 2 if the CMA believes that it is or may be the case that a relevant merger situation has been created, or arrangements are in progress or contemplation which, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation; and the creation of that situation has resulted, or may be expected to result, in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services.

  alongside vital job support to lift incomes, the new £15 billion package to help with the cost of living will help millions of households
Today the Prime Minister and Work and Pensions Secretary urged employers of all sizes to use the free recruitment support from their local Jobcentre to help fill the record number of vacancies in the jobs market and support the continued economic recovery by getting people into work.

Since January, DWP jobcentres across the UK have been ramping up operations with weekly jobs fairs – bringing employers in for face-to-face appointments and offering jobs on the spot to thousands of people.

Jobseekers walking away with roles have also secured an income, with those getting full time work set to be thousands of pounds better off than if they were on benefits. Helping households improve their finances and manage current cost of living pressures is a key priority for the government, with a £15 billion package announced yesterday to support almost all of the eight million most vulnerable households across the UK.

Today in the North East of England, the Prime Minister and Work and Pensions Secretary visited CityFibre, a new employer to the Way to Work campaign who have already benefitted from 200 new recruits from around the UK, hired through their local Jobcentres. During the visit, they also met local employees who have secured skilled jobs as a result of the campaign and the support of their local Jobcentre.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:

“I was only ten years old when unemployment was last this low.

“But with a vast number of vacancies in the jobs market, it is more critical than ever to access the huge pool of untapped talent in towns and cities right across the country, which is why I am thrilled with the progress we have made with the Way to Work scheme.”

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Thérèse Coffey said:


  Unemployment is at its lowest since the 1970s with full time workers across the UK £6000 better off than if they were on benefits.

  And there are still vacancies to fill. That’s why our jobcentres are helping employers short circuit the recruitment process so they can get talent in fast.

  So, if you’re hiring, make the most of the help on offer from us.


Greg Mesch, Chief Executive at CityFibre said:


  CityFibre is rolling out the UK’s finest digital infrastructure to millions of homes and businesses nationwide. To build these new Full Fibre networks, we’re creating thousands of new network construction  jobs and providing industry training to those that need it.

  We and our construction partners are working closely with DWP nationally, and local Jobcentres, by engaging with schemes like Way to Work. We look forward to increasing our involvement in the future.


Alongside vital job support to help jobseekers secure an income, the new £15 billion cost of living support package will help almost all of the eight million most vulnerable households across the UK as they are set to receive help of at least £1,200 this year, including a new one-off £650 cost of living payment.

The government has also announced a £500 million increase for the Household Support Fund, delivered by local authorities, extending it to March 2023. This brings the total Household Support Fund to £1.5 billion.
"
"109",2022-05-26,"Statement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on Cost of Living Support.","
    
          
Madam Deputy Speaker,

The high inflation we are experiencing now is causing acute distress for the people of this country.

I know they are worried, I know people are struggling.

I want to explain what is happening, why it is happening, and what we propose to do about it.

I trust the British people, and I know they understand no government can solve every problem, particularly the complex and global challenge of inflation.

But this government will never stop trying to help people, to fix problems where we can, to do what is right – as we did throughout the pandemic.

We need to make sure that for those whom the struggle is too hard…and for whom the risks are too great…they are supported.

This government will not sit idly by whilst there is a risk that some in our country might be set so far back… they might never recover.

This is simply unacceptable. I will never allow that happen.

And I want to reassure everybody – we will get through this.

We have the tools and the determination we need to combat and reduce inflation.

We will make sure the most vulnerable and the least well off get the support they need at this time of difficulty.

And we will turn this moment of difficulty into a springboard for economic renewal and growth.

With more jobs, higher skills, greater investment - our plan for a stronger economy.

Madam Deputy Speaker,

Before I turn to the details of our plan, let me put into context for the House, the challenge we face.

This country is now experiencing the highest rate of inflation we have seen for forty years.

The Bank of England expect inflation to average around 9% this year.

Our exposure to global shocks continues to explain most of the inflation above the 2% target.

Supply chain disruption as the world reopened from Covid…

…combined with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine…

…and potentially exacerbated by recent lockdowns in China…

…are all contributing to significant price increases for goods and energy.

However, over the course of this year, the situation has evolved and has become more serious.

There are areas of particular concern.

Even excluding energy and food, core inflation has become broader based and elevated.

Of the basket of goods and services we use to measure inflation, a record proportion are seeing above average price increases.

Also, we are acutely exposed to the European energy price shock and, like the US, we have a tight labour market.

Make no mistake – the lowest unemployment in almost 50 years, just months after averting a jobs crisis during the pandemic, is good news.

But combined with the shock to European energy prices, it does contribute to the UK’s relatively high rate of inflation.

And lastly, as the Bank have noted, longer-term inflation expectations have risen above their historical averages, by more than they are in the US and Europe.

We cannot and must not allow short term inflationary pressures to lead people to expect that high inflation will continue over the long term.

Because Madam Deputy Speaker

We can get inflation under control.

It is not some abstract force outside our grasp.

It may take time, but we have the tools we need and the resolve it will take to reduce inflation.

Madam Deputy Speaker,

We have three specific tools available to combat and reduce inflation – and we are using them all.

Independent monetary policy. Fiscal responsibility. And supply side activism.

First, our primary tool is a strong, independent monetary policy.

Since control of monetary policy was taken out of the hands of politicians 25 years ago, inflation has averaged precisely 2%.

It is right the Bank of England are independent.

And I know the Governor and his team will take decisive action to get inflation back on target and ensure inflation expectations remain firmly anchored.

Second, we need responsible fiscal policy.

That means providing fiscal support where required but not making the situation unnecessarily worse…causing inflation, interest, and mortgage rates to go up further than they otherwise would.

Excessively adding fiscal stimulus into a supply constrained economy…

…especially one in which households and businesses have built up over £300 billion of excess savings…

…risks being counterproductive and increasing inflationary pressures.

In other words, fiscal support should be timely, targeted, and temporary.

Timely, because we need to help people when the shock is at its worst.

Targeted, because unconstrained stimulus will make the problem worse.

And temporary, because if we do not meet our fiscal rules, and ensure the public finances are resilient in the longer run…

…we create even greater risks on inflation, interest rates, and the trend rate of economic growth.

And third, we are taking an activist approach to supply side reforms.

This will increase our productive capacity, ease inflationary pressures, and raise our long-term growth potential.

The PM’s energy security strategy will, over time, reduce bills by increasing energy supply and improving energy efficiency.

The W&P Secretary is moving half a million jobseekers off welfare and into work…

…and doing more to support older people back into the jobs market.

The Home Secretary is making our visa regime for high-skilled migrants one of the most competitive in the world.

And, in the autumn, we will bring forward tax cuts and reforms to encourage businesses to invest more, train more, and innovate more – the path to higher growth.

So, independent monetary policy.

Fiscal responsibility.

Supply side reform.

The country should have confidence, that using these three tools…

…we will combat inflation – and reduce it over time.

But of course, we know that households are being hit hard, right now.

So today, Madam Deputy Speaker, we will provide significant support to the British people.

But as I have said, a critical part of how we are dealing with inflation is responsible fiscal policy.

What this means in practical terms is that as we support people more, we need to think about the fairest way to fund as much of that cost as possible.

The oil and gas sector is making extraordinary profits.

Not as the result of recent changes to risk taking or innovation or efficiency.

But as the result of surging global commodity prices – driven in part by Russia’s war.

And for that reason, I am sympathetic to the argument to tax those profits fairly.

But as ever, there is a sensible middle ground.

We should not be ideological about this…we should be pragmatic.

It is possible to both tax extraordinary profits fairly…and incentivise investment.

And so, like previous governments, including Conservative ones – we will introduce a temporary, targeted, Energy Profits Levy.

But, we have built into the new Levy a new Investment Allowance, similar to the super-deduction…

…that means companies will have a new and significant incentive to reinvest their profits.

The new Levy will be charged on profits of oil and gas companies at a rate of 25%.

It will be temporary, and when oil and gas prices return to historically more normal levels, the Levy will be phased out – and with a sunset clause written into the legislation.

And, crucially, with our new investment allowance, we are nearly doubling the overall investment relief for oil and gas companies.

This means that, for every £1 a company invests, they’ll get back 90 per cent in tax relief.

So the more a company invests, the less tax they will pay.

And we understand that certain parts of the electricity generation sector are also making extraordinary profits.

The reason for this is the way our market works.

The price electricity generators are paid is linked not to the costs they incur in providing that electricity…but rather to the price of natural gas – which is extraordinarily high right now.

Other countries like France, Italy, Spain and Greece have already taken measures to correct this.

As set out in the Energy Security Strategy, we are consulting with the power generation sector and investors…

…to drive forward energy market reforms and ensure that the price paid for electricity is more reflective of the costs of production.

Those reforms will take time to implement.

So, in the meantime, we are urgently evaluating the scale of these extraordinary profits…and the appropriate steps to take.

So, Madam Deputy Speaker,

Our Energy Profits Levy will encourage investment, not deter it.

It raises around £5bn revenue over the next year so that we can help families with the cost of living.

And it avoids having to increase our debt burden further.

Because there is nothing noble in burdening future generations with ever more debt to pay…

…because politicians of the day were too weak to make the tough decisions.

Madam Deputy Speaker,

I know the whole House will agree we have a responsibility to help those who…

…through no fault of their own…

…are paying the highest price for the inflation we face.

To help with the cost of living, we are going to provide significant, targeted support to millions of the most vulnerable people in our society:

Those on the lowest incomes, pensioners, and disabled people.

First, people on the lowest incomes.

Over eight million households already have incomes low enough for the state to be supporting their cost of living through the welfare system.

They could be temporarily unemployed and looking for work.

Unable to work because of long-term sickness or disability.

Or on low pay and using benefits to top up their wages.

Right now, they face incredibly difficult choices.

So, I can announce today we will send, directly to around eight million of the lowest income households, a one-off Cost of Living Payment of £650.

Support worth over £5bn to give vulnerable people certainty that we are standing by them at this challenging time.

DWP will make the payment in two lump sums - the first from July, the second in autumn, with payments from HMRC for those on Tax Credits, following shortly after.

There is no need for people to fill out complicated forms or bureaucracy – we will send the payment straight into their bank accounts.

Our policy will benefit over eight million households in receipt of means-tested benefits, from July.

Uprating, in that time frame, could only be done for those on Universal Credit.

And our policy will provide a larger average payment this year of £650.

Whereas uprating the same benefits by 9% would only be worth, on average, £530.

There are two further groups who will need targeted extra support.

Many pensioners are disproportionately impacted by higher energy costs.

They can’t always increase their incomes through work.

And, because they spend more time at home, and are more vulnerable, they often need to keep the heating on for longer.

And we estimate many people who are eligible for Pension Credit are not currently claiming it…

…which means there will be many vulnerable pensioners not receiving means-tested benefits.

So, I can announce today that, from the autumn, we will send over eight million pensioner households who receive the Winter Fuel Payment – an extra, one-off Pensioner Cost of Living Payment of £300.

Disabled people also face extra costs in their day-to-day lives – like having energy-intensive equipment around the home or workplace.

So, to help the 6 million people who receive non-means tested disability benefits, we will send them, from September…

…an extra, one-off Disability Cost of Living Payment, worth £150.

Many disabled people will also receive the payment of £650 I have already announced, taking their total cost of living payments to £800.

And I can reassure the House that next year, subject to the Secretary of State’s review, benefits will be uprated by this September’s CPI…

…which, on current forecasts, is likely to be significantly higher than the forecast inflation rate for next year.

Similarly, the triple lock will apply for the state pension.

Of course, we recognise the risk that, as with any policy, there may be small numbers of people who fall between the cracks.

For example, it is not possible right now for DWP or HMRC to identify people on Housing Benefit who are not also claiming other benefits.

So, to support them and others, we will extend the Household Support Fund, delivered by Local Authorities, by £500m from October.

This is a significant set of interventions to support the most vulnerable in our country.

We will legislate to deliver this support on the same terms in every part of the United Kingdom – including Northern Ireland.

And, taken together, our direct cash payments, will help one third of all UK households with the cost of living, support worth over £9bn.

So, Madam Deputy Speaker,

We are meeting our responsibility to provide the most help to those on the lowest incomes.

I believe that is fair and I’m confident the House would agree.

But there are many other families who do not require state support in normal times.

They are also facing challenging times.

Is it fair to leave them unsupported?

The answer must surely be no.

While it is impossible for any government to solve every problem, we can and will ease the burden as we help the entire country through the worst of this crisis.

So, we will provide more support with the rising cost of energy – and that support will be universal.

Earlier this year, we announced £9bn to help with the cost of energy.

Including a Council Tax rebate of £150 for tens of millions of households.

And we plan to provide all households with £200 off their energy bills from October, with the cost of that repaid over the following five years.

Since then, the outlook for energy prices has changed.

I’ve heard people’s concerns about the impact of these repayments on future bills.

So I have decided that those repayments will be cancelled.

So, for the avoidance of doubt, this support is unambiguously a grant.

And furthermore, I have decided that the £200 of support for household energy bills will be doubled to £400 for everyone.

We’re on the side of hard-working families, with £6bn of financial support.

So, Madam Deputy Speaker,

To summarise.

Our strategy is to combat and reduce inflation over time through independent monetary policy, fiscal responsibility, and supply side activism.

We are raising emergency funds to help millions of the most vulnerable families who are struggling right now.

And all households will benefit from universal support for energy bills of £400 – with not a penny to repay.

In total, the measures I’ve announced today provide support worth £15bn.

Combined with the plans we’ve already announced…that means we are supporting families with the cost of living to the tune of £37bn or 1.5% of GDP.

That’s higher or similar to countries like France, Germany, and Italy.

And I’m proud to say that around three quarters of the total support will go to vulnerable households.

As a result of the measures we’ve announced today, and the action we’ve already taken this year:

The vast majority of households will receive £550.

Pensioners will receive £850.

And almost all of the eight million most vulnerable households in the country will, in total, receive support of at least £1,200.

Let me put this into context.

The House will have noted the news from Ofgem earlier this week.

They currently expect the energy price cap to rise in October to £2,800.

That’s an average increase in people’s bills this year of just under £1,200.

The same amount our policies will provide for the most vulnerable this year.

I know there are other pressures.

I am not trying to claim we have solved the entire problem for everyone.

No government could.

But I hope that when people hear the significant steps we are taking…

…the millions we are helping…

…they will feel some of the burden eased, some of the pressures lifted.

And they will know, this Government is standing by them.

And Madam Deputy Speaker in conclusion,

Supporting people with the cost of living is only one part of our plan for a stronger economy…

…A plan that is creating more jobs…

…Cutting taxes for working people…

…Reducing our borrowing and debt…

…Driving businesses to invest and innovate more…

…unleashing a skills revolution…

…Seizing the benefits of Brexit…

…And levelling up growth in all parts of the United Kingdom.

The British people can trust this government because we have a plan for a stronger economy and I commend this Statement to the House.

"110",2022-05-26,"The CMA is investigating whether Google has broken the law by restricting competition in the digital advertising technology market.","
    
          CMA launches second investigation into Google’s practices in ad tech, following launch of probe into Google and Meta’s ‘Jedi Blue’ agreement.
Advertising technology intermediation, also known as the ‘ad tech stack’, is a complex set of services which facilitate the sale of online advertising space between sellers (publishers, like online newspapers and other content providers) and buyers (advertisers). In 2019, UK advertisers spent around £1.8 billion on this kind of online advertising. The market is important because millions of people across the UK use websites that rely on advertising revenue to offer high-quality, free content.

Google has strong positions at various levels of the ad tech stack, charging fees to both publishers and advertisers.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is examining 3 key parts of this chain, in each of which Google owns the largest service provider:

Demand-side platforms (DSPs) allow advertisers and media agencies to buy publishers’ advertising inventory (i.e. the space they have for advertising) from many sources.
  Ad exchanges provide the technology to automate the sale of publishers’ inventory. They allow real-time auctions by connecting to multiple DSPs, collecting bids from them.
  Publisher ad servers manage the publisher’s inventory and decide which ad to show, based on the bids received from different exchanges and/or direct deals between publishers and advertisers.
The CMA is assessing whether Google’s practices in these parts of the ad tech stack may distort competition. These include whether Google limited the interoperability of its ad exchange with third-party publisher ad servers and/or contractually tied these services together, making it more difficult for rival ad servers to compete.

The CMA is also concerned that Google may have used its publisher ad server and its DSPs to illegally favour its own ad exchange services, while taking steps to exclude the services offered by rivals.

Andrea Coscelli, the CMA’s Chief Executive, said:


  We’re worried that Google may be using its position in ad tech to favour its own services to the detriment of its rivals, of its customers and ultimately of consumers.

  This would be bad for the millions of people who enjoy access to a wealth of free information online every day.

  Weakening competition in this area could reduce the ad revenues of publishers, who may be forced to compromise the quality of their content to cut costs or put their content behind paywalls. It may also be raising costs for advertisers which are passed on through higher prices for advertised goods and services.

  It’s vital that we continue to scrutinise the behaviour of the tech firms which loom large over our lives and ensure the best outcomes for people and businesses throughout the UK.


This case follows on from the CMA’s market study into online platforms and digital advertising which identified significant issues and made an assessment of possible solutions to address market power in ad tech. The CMA will consider these further in the course of its investigation. The CMA has subsequently opened a competition investigation into Google and Meta’s ‘Jedi Blue’ agreement in relation to header bidding services, which are a part of the wider ad tech stack. The CMA is also monitoring compliance with commitments Google made in relation to its Privacy Sandbox proposals to remove third-party cookies and other functionality from Google’s Chrome browser.

A draft Bill to give the CMA more powers to govern the behaviour of big tech firms, through the Digital Markets Unit, was recently announced in the Queen’s Speech.

Until this legislation is in place, the CMA will forge ahead using its existing powers in the tech sector, including probes into Apple’s App Store, Meta’s use of data and Apple and Google’s mobile ecosystems over competition concerns.

The CMA maintains a joined-up approach across all related cases to ensure the best outcomes for people and businesses throughout the UK.

The European Commission (EC) has launched its own investigation into Google’s practices in the ad tech sector. Google practices are also the subject of a complaint by the State of Texas (PDF, 3.28MB) (and other US States) currently in the US courts. In July 2021, the French Autorité de la Concurrence closed a similar case against Google (PDF, 1.35MB) having imposed a fine and secured commitments.

Find out more about the CMA’s investigation on the investigation into suspected anti-competitive conduct by Google in ad tech case page.

Notes to editors

The competition legislation relevant to the CMA’s investigation is the Competition Act 1998. This case concerns Chapter II prohibition (which makes it illegal for a company that holds a dominant position from behaving to the detriment of competition).
  “Google” refers to Google UK Limited, Google LLC and Alphabet Inc.
  The CMA may launch an investigation under the Competition Act 1998 if it has reasonable grounds to believe that there has been an infringement of competition law. If the CMA decides that there has been a breach of competition law then it can impose a fine up to 10% of Google’s worldwide turnover, as well as issue legally binding directions to bring the breach to an end.
  No conclusion should be made that the law has been broken. The CMA has made no decision that Google’s conduct needs to change.

"111",2022-05-25,"More than 1,000 Ukrainian pensioners who recently arrived in Britain after fleeing the Russian invasion are already receiving financial support through Pension Credit, new figures show.","
    
          The figures follow emergency regulations laid by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) in March 2022 which enabled Ukrainians to immediately access benefits and other support upon their arrival.

Minister for Pensions Guy Opperman said:


  Our priority is ensuring those arriving from Ukraine can find safety here and get the support they need.



  Pension Credit provides a vital financial boost which is why we’re helping new arrivals apply, with translation services available for phone applications.



  I urge those hosting elderly Ukrainians – and all those across the country with older relatives and friends – to check with them and see if they could be eligible for this extra financial assistance.


As well as help with daily living costs of up to £182.60 per week for single people and £278.70 for couples, Pension Credit also opens up access to other support, such as help with rent and council tax, heating bills, free NHS dental care and free TV licenses for the over-75s.

To be eligible for Pension Credit, people need to be over State Pension age and on a low income. More than 1.4 million pensioners across Great Britain currently receive Pension Credit and take-up is at its highest level since 2010.

The government recently launched a campaign to boost take-up of Pension Credit among UK pensioners. The campaign aims to increase take-up both by encouraging older people to claim and encouraging others to speak to their retired friends and loved ones about the support.

The easiest way for Ukrainian nationals to apply for Pension Credit is by phone and the department has made translation services available to help new arrivals with their applications. The Freephone number: 0800 99 1234, is available Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm.

DWP staff are also delivering additional face-to-face assistance to those who need it, including advice on benefit eligibility and support with online applications.

Immediate access to Pension Credit and other means-tested benefits is just one of the ways the UK is continuing to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Ukrainian people and those forced to flee the country following Russia’s barbaric invasion.

          The meeting, which took place on Tuesday 24 May 2022, sought to build on the UK G7 agenda from 2021, which focussed on building back better, greener and more inclusively.

This year delegates focussed on structural change to the labour market in the context of decarbonisation, digitalisation and demographic change.

The Secretary of State outlined the UK’s commitment to achieving net zero by 2050, and delivering on the commitments made at COP26, including by greening pension scheme investments.

Work and Pensions Secretary Thérèse Coffey, said:


  Moving away from high carbon jobs to green jobs is a crucial part of achieving our net zero goals. The creation of high-quality jobs in sustainable sectors, ensures the opportunities are well paid.



  I very much support the sharing of knowledge and expertise with counterparts across the globe and welcome the opportunity to build on the UK’s G7 Presidency of 2021. It’s essential we work together to grow the economy to address the cost of living.


The UK published the Net Zero Strategy in 2021, committing to help businesses and consumers move to clean power, leveraging up to £90 billion of private investment by 2030, and reduce emissions across the economy by at least 68% by 2030 and 78% by 2035.

Through moving to green jobs or greening existing sectors, the government will support 190,000 green jobs across the UK by 2025 and a total of 440,000 net zero jobs, contributing to our goal to support two million green jobs by 2030.

The meeting closed with all delegates adopting a communique, agreeing concrete actions and joint steps towards a just transition and the creation of decent, high-quality work for a green economy.

To further promote continuity and to prioritize coordinated action across the G7 on critical labour, social and employment issues, delegates also established a standing Employment Working Group within the G7 with the aim to convene as ministers on an annual basis.

"113",2022-05-24,"Hundreds of customers that buy domestic gas from BDS Fuels will be freed from unlawful exclusivity contracts.","
    
          Over 700 households in the North West of England will now be freed from unlawful terms that locked them into repeat exclusivity contracts and restricted their ability to switch to a new gas provider.
The move by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) comes after concerns were raised about customers being automatically locked into new ‘exclusivity contracts’ for liquified petroleum gas (LPG) – an expensive domestic fuel used for heating and cooking by people who cannot access the UK mains gas grid. Customers were required to pay a £350 fee if they wished to break the contract and change providers. It is unlawful to automatically roll over these exclusivity contracts without customers’ explicit agreement.

Having scrutinised BDS Fuels’ contracts, the CMA found the firm had unlawfully used a clause that automatically renewed over 700 households’ exclusivity contracts without their explicit consent. This meant hundreds of customers in Cumbria, North Lancashire, and North Yorkshire were unable to switch to a new provider – who may have been able to offer them a cheaper or better deal – without paying BDS a fee.

Following the CMA’s intervention, BDS has now agreed to:

Remove unlawful automatic renewal clauses from its LPG contracts
  Inform all existing customers who were automatically signed up to a new exclusivity contract that they can switch supplier with immediate effect and without paying a fee if they choose to
  Refund those customers who paid a fee to be released from their LPG contract early
  Provide information to customers annually that clearly details how they can cancel their contract and switch providers
Adam Land, Senior Director for Remedies, Business, and Financial Analysis at the CMA, said:


  We are facing a cost-of-living crisis meaning it’s more important than ever that people can shop around and choose the best possible deal for them. If we find evidence of businesses preventing this, we won’t hesitate to step in – as we have with BDS Fuels.


The CMA will monitor BDS to make sure it is behaving in accordance with the Order and taking the action promised. Should it fail to do either of these, the CMA could step in and launch enforcement action.

For more information, please see the CMA’s Letter to BDS Fuels.

Notes to editors

According to BDS Fuels’ website, the firm distributes to: Cumbria, North Lancashire, North Yorkshire, and South West Scottish Borders.
  Liquified Petroleum Gas is a domestic fuel used for cooking and heating. It is used in homes that are not on the mains gas grid and is stored in tanks on-site.
  BDS Fuels breached the Domestic Bulk Liquefied Petroleum Gas Market Investigation Order (PDF, 326KB) (put in place by the CMA’s predecessor The Competition Commission) in 2 ways, first, by failing to limit the exclusivity period in contracts to 24 months, and second, by failing to provide important information to 757 customers when providing them with contracts.
  The CMA cannot currently impose financial penalties on businesses for breaches of this kind, but the UK Government has consulted on providing this power in the future. This power would allow the CMA to increase the deterrent effect of its enforcement and make sure businesses take the obligations which the CMA imposes on them seriously for the benefit of UK consumers.

"114",2022-05-20,"Biggest funding package in a generation to tackle youth offending and cut crime.","
    
          

new ‘Turnaround’ scheme to catch troubled young people teetering on edge of criminality
  up to 20,000 more children and young people to be helped over next 3 years


Thousands of troubled children and teenagers teetering on the edge of crime will be put back on the right track thanks to the largest youth justice funding boost in a generation – cutting crime and making streets safer.

Around 80 percent of prolific adult offenders begin committing crimes as children, and the estimated cost of late intervention to the economy is nearly £17 billion per year.

That’s why the government is making the biggest investment in a generation – worth £300 million over the next 3 years – to support every single council across England and Wales in catching and preventing youth offending earlier than ever, helping to stop these children and teenagers from moving on to further, more serious offending.

And for the first time ever, local authorities will be given specific cash to intervene early with teenagers displaying signs such as poor school attendance, troubles at home, and a history of substance abuse which are known to be factors which often drive young people into crime – so they can steer them away from law-breaking before an offence is even committed.

Through ‘Turnaround’, a new early intervention scheme backed by £60 million, local Youth Offending Teams will be given extra funding to connect children and teenagers to targeted, wraparound support to stop them going down a path of criminality.

This could include mentoring, extra school tuition, sports clubs, help to address any issues at school or at home, with their mental health or with substance misuse, tackling the root causes of their behaviour and helping them to get their lives back on track.

Funding will also be used to bolster the day-to-day running of youth justice schemes and initiatives across the country, as well as support the work of the 20,000 additional police officers the government is committed to recruiting.

As part of today’s news, the Deputy Prime Minister, Dominic Raab, visited a community boxing scheme in Blackpool that is giving local children and teenagers an alternative to anti-social behaviour, giving them skills such as discipline and teamwork, and steering them away from potential offending and back into education and training.

Deputy Prime Minister, Lord Chancellor, and Secretary of State for Justice Dominic Raab said:


  Diverting more young people from gangs, drugs and violence will make our streets safer.
So, we’re investing £300 million in preventative initiatives, to deter criminal behaviour.

  Our plan will ensure thousands more young people can turn their lives around - which will transform their lives and make our communities safer.


Minister for Youth Justice Victoria Atkins said:


  Youth offending is a destructive force that blights communities and rips families apart.

  This vital new funding will help us stop youth crime in its tracks by ensuring these children stay in education and rebuild ties with their families, helping us build safer, more prosperous communities.


Youth Justice Board Chair Keith Fraser said:


  This is a smart and insightful investment by the government. If our youth justice teams are well-resourced to help children and families, we all benefit - from healthier, happier, safer children and from safer communities with fewer victims.

  This investment highlights the importance of their work and is a huge opportunity for youth justice teams across England and Wales. I hope they feel rightly proud of the contribution they make to the safety of communities and the lives of children.



Ministers estimate that the Turnaround programme will reach up to 20,000 more children over three years who would not otherwise have received support to turn away from offending.

While many local authorities already run successful early intervention programmes, by providing funding over a three-year period, councils will have greater certainty and be able to plan longer-term – ultimately steering more children and teenagers than ever away from crime.

Ministers will also set out plans in due course to improve how funding is targeted to local authorities, to ensure funding reaches areas who need it most and to ensure local authorities’ interventions are effective.

"115",2022-05-17,"The government’s goal to see one million more disabled people in work has been reached, the latest official figures show.","
    
          Over one million more disabled people are in employment compared to five years ago according to the latest ONS (Office for National Statistics) data released today (Tuesday 17 May), confirming the government has achieved a key ambition in its efforts improve the lives of disabled people.

The latest figures show the number of disabled people in employment has increased by 1.3 million since 2017, delivering on a government goal to see one million more in work by 2027.

The 10-year employment goal was a government manifesto commitment originally set in 2017 to break down barriers for disabled people and those with health conditions and to build more diverse and inclusive workforces.

Welcoming the milestone and recognising that more can be done, the Minister for Disabled People will tomorrow (Wednesday 18 May) open a Disability Confident jobs fair at Hillman Street Jobcentre in Hackney, East London.

The event has been set up to give jobseekers with disabilities the chance to meet local employers, support groups and work coaches to help them access work and training opportunities that meet their career goals, as work is the best way for people to get on and improve their lives.

Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work Chloe Smith MP said:


  This is an important milestone showing our commitment to supporting disabled people to lead independent lives and reach their full potential.



  Ensuring everyone has the same opportunity for a fulfilling working life is a key part of levelling up the country and we will continue to push for greater accessibility and inclusion for disabled jobseekers.


There are a range of government initiatives, including schemes in partnership with the health system, to support those with disabilities and health conditions to live independent lives and to start, stay and succeed in employment.

One of these, the Disability Confident scheme, helps employers create more accessible and diverse workforces by championing inclusive recruitment practices. The scheme, which covers 11 million paid workers, helps employers think differently about disability, and improve how they attract, recruit and retain disabled workers. Ford, Sainsbury’s, Hilton and Coca-Cola are among the thousands of organisations across the UK signed up to the scheme aimed at boosting the number of disabled people in work.

Over the next three years, the government will invest £1.3 billion in employment support for disabled people and people with health conditions. This money will go toward building up existing provision, including expanding employment support, to grow the economy and help people with the cost of living.

Freeze will help ease the cost of living pressures on households, saving £17 million overall
  Comes alongside record government NHS investment to tackle the COVID-19 backlog and reduce waiting times
NHS prescription charges will be frozen for the first time in 12 years to help with the cost of living.

Charges usually increase in line with average inflation. This year – in a move not seen for over a decade – the cost for prescriptions will remain the same to help ease cost of living pressures and ensure prescription medication remains accessible.

This means people in England who pay prescription charges are saving £17 million overall. Charges for prescriptions will remain at £9.35 for a single charge or £30.25 for a 3-month prescription prepayment certificate (PPC).

12-month PPCs will remain at £108.10 and can be paid for in instalments, meaning people can get all the medicines they need for just over £2 a week.

In addition to the freeze on charges, the NHS low income scheme offers help with prescription payments, with free prescriptions for eligible people in certain groups such as pensioners, students, and those who receive state benefits or live in care homes.

Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said:


  The rise in the cost of living has been unavoidable as we face global challenges and the repercussions of Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine. While we cannot completely prevent these rises, where we can help, we absolutely will.

  This is why I am freezing prescription charges to help ease some of these pressures and put money back in people’s pockets.


The government and NHS is working to tackle the COVID-19 backlogs while reforming routine care services, ending long waits and improving patient care. The pandemic has put huge pressure on health and care services and over the next 3 years, a record £39 billion will be invested through the Health and Care Levy, so the NHS has the funding it needs. The NHS is opening new surgical hubs and 160 community diagnostic centres so patients have easier access to tests closer to home – with 88 already open, delivering over 800,000 scans.

In addition, the Health and Care Bill received Royal Assent last month, enacting the most significant health legislation in a decade into law. It marks an important step in the government’s ambitious health and care agenda, setting up systems and structures to reform how health and adult social care work together, tackle long waiting lists built up during the pandemic, and address some of the long-term challenges faced by the country including a growing and ageing population, chronic conditions and inequalities in health outcomes.

The government is listening to people’s concerns and targeting support at the lowest paid in society, with measures worth over £22 billion in 2022 to 2023 to help with the cost of energy bills and to ensure people keep more of their money. This includes raising the threshold at which people start to pay National Insurance to £12,570, providing a £330 a year tax cut to 30 million workers in July. The National Living Wage has risen to £9.50 per hour – an extra £1,000 a year for a full-time worker, and taxes have been cut for the lowest paid workers on Universal Credit – so they can keep more of what they earn.

The prescription freeze will also apply to NHS wigs and fabric supports. These prices will remain at current levels:

surgical bra £30.70
  abdominal or spinal support £46.30
  stock modacrylic wig £75.70
  partial human hair wig £200.50
  full bespoke human hair wig £293.20

"117",2022-05-11,"The CMA’s most senior enforcer has warned that anyone looking to exploit the cost-of-living crisis by forming cartels risk robust enforcement action, including possible dawn raids.","
    
          In a speech today Michael Grenfell, Executive Director of enforcement at the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), said the cost-of-living crisis would have a ‘huge impact’ on consumers but that competition was key to minimising that impact.  

He added that:


  We will tackle anti-competitive practices and transactions that unnecessarily raise prices. We will not allow cartelists to treat the current economic circumstances as an excuse for anti-competitive collusion that makes things worse for consumers. The dawn raids we have launched already this year should serve as a signal of our intent.


He also said that the CMA will continue to crack down on unfair practices such as subscription traps ‘that make things worse’.


  We have already used our consumer protection law powers to address the practice of subscription traps – the way suppliers make it harder for consumers who have signed up to a subscription subsequently to be free of it, especially as prices rise – and have secured improvements in the terms and conditions for subscriptions to anti-virus software and to online video games.

"118",2022-04-29,"The CMA has published its second assessment of how well competition is working in the UK and what that means for people and businesses.","
    
          Effective competition helps make sure shoppers and households get a fair deal when buying goods and services. This is especially important at a time when the UK is recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic and facing a rising cost of living.

Recognising the importance of competition, the Chancellor and the Business Secretary asked the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to assess the state of competition in the UK economy.

This is the second report of its kind that the CMA has produced.

Building on its first report, the CMA has improved the techniques it uses to measure indicators of competition like market concentration, firms’ profitability and markups, and market entry and exit levels.

Key findings include:

The level to which markets are dominated by a limited number of companies - their concentration - remains higher than it was before the financial crisis of 2008.
  Concentration is higher when ‘common ownership’, where competing firms are owned by the same companies, is factored in but lower when accounting for international trade.
  Lower income households are more likely to consume goods and services produced in more concentrated markets. This is because a higher proportion of their income is spent on essential services, like gas and water, which tend to be produced by a limited number of companies.
  Average markups - the amount added to the cost price of goods to cover overheads and profit - have increased since 2008, from just over 20% to about 35%, with the increase in markup being higher for the 10% most profitable firms.
  Evidence suggests that the largest and most profitable firms are able to sustain their strong position for longer than they used to, with the likelihood of the largest firms in an industry remaining the largest firms increasing over the last 20 years.
  Digital markets have huge potential to improve our lives and living standards and to play an important role in the post-pandemic recovery. But to deliver those benefits, they need to stay competitive. Weak competition in digital markets, like search engines, mobile ecosystems and social media, risks reducing innovation and choice, and leading to people giving up more personal data than they would like.
In its report, the CMA also analyses surveys which asked people about their direct experience of problems with goods and services they purchased. The BEIS Consumer Protection Study 2022 estimates that issues with purchased goods and services cost UK consumers £54.2 billion in the year to April 2021, with two-fifths of issues arising from just four sectors: renting services, vehicle maintenance and repair, second-hand vehicles, and internet provision. Consumers reported that around £7.7 billion of this cost (14% of the total) was caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

The pandemic was also felt to have played a large part in the majority of issues people experienced with services provided by airlines and package holidays and tours sectors.

Mike Walker, Chief Economic Adviser at the CMA, said:


  Our State of Competition report shows a worrying combination of trends. We are seeing markets getting more concentrated, companies enjoying higher mark-ups and the biggest firms maintaining their leading positions for longer. The fact that all these indicators are pointing in the same direction provides a warning sign about the state of competition in the UK.

  What’s more, we’ve found that the poorest households are likely to suffer the effects of these changes the most - at the very time when they are already being hit by sharp rises in the cost of essential items.

  We will use our findings to direct our work to keep markets competitive and protect consumers at this crucial time.


The CMA’s report is informed by its knowledge of markets and work enforcing consumer and competition law. It has also included insights of outside experts, academic advisors and other parts of government.

"119",2022-04-28,"The Government has concluded that it would be wrong to impose new administrative requirements on businesses who may pass-on the associated costs to consumers.","
    
          
The remaining import controls on EU goods will no longer be introduced this year, the government has announced today.

Instead, traders will continue to move their goods from the European Union to Great Britain  as they do now.

Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, and the recent rise in global energy costs, have had a significant effect on supply chains that are still recovering from the pandemic.

The government has therefore concluded that it would be wrong to impose new administrative requirements on businesses who may pass-on the associated costs to consumers already facing pressures on their finances.

The change in approach is expected to save British importers at least £1 billion in annual costs.

The Government will now review how to implement these remaining controls in an improved way. The new Target Operating Model will be based on a better assessment of risk and will harness the power of data and technology. It will be published in the Autumn and the new controls regime will come into force at the end of 2023.

This process will build on existing work already taking place as part of the 2025 Border Strategy, including on the UK Single Trade Window – a new digital platform that will help traders to more easily move goods globally. Our goal is to create a seamless new ‘digital’ border, where technologies and real-time data will cut queues and smooth trade.

The controls introduced in January 2021 on the highest risk imports of animals, animal products, plants and plant products will continue to apply alongside the customs controls which have already been introduced.

Minister for Brexit Opportunities, Jacob Rees-Mogg said:


  Today’s decision will allow British businesses to focus on their recovery from the pandemic, navigate global supply chain issues and ensure that new costs are not passed on to consumers.

  It’s vital that we have the right import controls regime in place, so we’ll now be working with industry to review these remaining controls so that they best suit the UK’s own interests.

  We want the process for importing goods from the EU to be safe, secure and efficient and we want to harness innovative new technologies to streamline processes and reduce frictions. It’s precisely because of Brexit that we’re able to build this UK-focussed system

  The UK Government is committed to ensuring the process for importing goods remains safe, secure and efficient and will harness innovative new technologies to streamline future processes and reduce frictions.

  Our engagement with industry will be guided by these objectives, and will build on existing work already taking place, including on the UK Single Trade Window – a new digital gateway that will help traders to more easily move goods globally.


John Keefe, Director of Public Affairs. Eurotunnel said:


  Eurotunnel supports this decision which will keep goods flowing seamlessly into the UK. It is good for traders as it reduces import declaration paperwork on food and perishables.

  It is good for transporters as it increases fluidity at the border and it is good for consumers as it keeps the cost of living down.


Michael Schymik, International Director of SEF Langdon’s said:


  The current paper-based SPS processes and procedures are unsuitable in a 21st century digital world.

  This change in policy towards a smarter digital border by the UK Government will allow the free flow of safe food products into Great Britain.

  The decision may lead to a return of more EU companies exporting to the GB market, increasing competition and ultimately lowering prices for the consumer.


Notes to editors:


    Controls no longer being introduced for EU goods July 2022 are:

    
        A requirement for Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) checks currently at destination to be moved to a Border Control Post (BCP)
      
      
        A requirement for safety and security declarations on EU imports
      
      
        A requirement for health certification for further SPS imports
      
      
        A requirement for SPS goods to be presented at a BCP

"120",2022-04-27,"The CMA’s Annual Concurrency Report shows how competition authorities have helped deliver benefits to households in 2021 to 2022 in the regulated sectors.","
    
          Competition law in the UK is enforced by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), the nation’s primary competition authority, and, in certain sectors, by the relevant regulators.

In order for the regime to work effectively, there are rules on how the CMA and the sector regulators work together, which are known as the ‘concurrency’ arrangements.

Sectors covered by these arrangements account for approximately 25% of UK GDP and include services that most people use every day, such as communications, energy and water. This year’s report is issued against the background of increasing concerns about the cost of living, following the economic shocks caused by the global Covid-19 pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine.

The report outlines how the CMA and other regulators have been working to promote competition and improve their collective ability to enforce the law. It also considers new challenges, like shortages and shipping bottlenecks, which have emerged over the past year as the global economy recovered from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Highlights of the 2021 to 2022 report include:

5 cases were brought to a close, including the PSR’s first infringement decision which led to fines totalling more than £33 million
  3 investigations – led by the CMA, Ofgem and Ofwat – resulted in firms signing formal commitments to improve their practices
  4 new investigations were launched –in the digital advertising, electric vehicle charging and financial services sectors
The report also shows how the concurrency arrangements allow the regulators to help each other on a range of matters, including technical advice on specific markets and procedural guidance in competition investigations.

Andrea Coscelli, CMA Chief Executive, said:


  This year, as we began to recover from the impacts of Covid-19, we also faced new challenges. The energy crisis and the invasion of Ukraine shook the world and have contributed to a sharp rise in the cost of living.

  During difficult times, effective cooperation between authorities is especially important to help ensure that essential services are working well for the millions of people who depend on them.

  By promoting healthy and competitive markets, we can help make sure households benefit from fair prices, good choice and quality services.

  I’m pleased with the positive outcomes our joined-up approach has brought this year – and I’m confident that the UK’s competition authorities will continue to help people get a fair deal.

"122",2022-04-13,"Abused women, drug addicts and offenders serving short sentences will be supported to turn their lives away from crime, as the Government backs specialist schemes aimed at criminals more likely to reoffend.","
    
          

Specialist schemes targeting criminals likely to reoffend backed by Government funding
  Focus on care leavers, drug addicts, abused women and short-sentence offenders
  Projects will tackle drivers of crime – such as unemployment, addiction and homelessness – and help to cut £18bn cost of reoffending


Today, the Government has confirmed it will support a further 11 projects through the Prison Leavers Project - a £20 million cross-government initiative helping offenders move on from their life of crime once they are released from jail.

With reoffending costing the taxpayer £18 billion and around 80 percent of offenders having at least one previous caution or conviction, the Government is committed to giving offenders a second chance to make a positive contribution to society and cut crime.

All the projects set to benefit from the almost £7 million pot tackle key drivers of offending – including addiction, unemployment, housing problems and social isolation. Statistics prove that offenders who are released from prison with nowhere to live are around 50 percent more likely to break the law again. While those have a job within 12 months of release, are up to nine percentage points less likely to reoffend.

The 11 pilot projects include:

A scheme in London specifically for offenders on short sentences which provides employment training and helps re-establish broken family ties
  A peer-mentoring project in the West Midlands providing mental health support and guidance on housing and finance for men who have grown up in care
  Creating realistic work environments in prisons in the North West, with the help of local employers, to boost job prospects once offenders leave
  Specialist support for female offenders with a history of abuse, in Wales and the South-West, to help them settle back into the community
Crime, Policing and Probation Minister Kit Malthouse said:


  These schemes cut straight to the heart of the reasons for reoffending – allowing us to find new and innovative ways to keep some of the hardest-to-reform criminals on the straight and narrow.



  We know that having a job on release, a safe place to stay as well as supportive family and friends are some of the vital ingredients for a crime-free life.



  Our pilots will provide support and hope, while helping us to reduce the £18 billion cost of repeat crime and better protect the public.


One London-based project benefitting from the £6.7million of government funding will help those on serial short sentences to go straight. Prison-leaver charity Bounce Back provides job opportunities – training offenders in their painting and decorating academy – and re-establishes broken but vital family ties so they have the support they need to turn their lives around.

In the West Midlands, charity Change, Grow, Live is helping offenders who have grown up in the care system to live crime-free lives through peer-mentoring and support with housing and employment coaching. Former offender Ian Thomas is one of the mentors for the project who is inspiring others after leaving his life of crime, drugs and homelessness to return to university and become a qualified Social Worker.

Ian Thomas, social worker, Change Grow Live project in the West Midlands said:


  I’ve experienced first-hand how leaving care without proper support can lead to a life of crime, addiction and homelessness.



  Thousands of prisoners have been in the care system, which shows need for projects like Change Grow Live in the West Midlands, which is driving real change among hard-to-reach groups.



  If we give prison leavers the support network they desperately need, we can reduce reoffending and give them the opportunity to thrive in the community.


In the North-West, New Futures Network and charity Antz Junction are working with local employers to tackle skills shortages in the construction and haulage industries. Offenders in HMPs Lancaster Farms, Kirkham, Liverpool, Thorn Cross will be trained-up in prison with the prospects of leaving for real jobs and crime-free lives.

While in Wales and the South-West, the funding will help addiction charity the Nelson Trust target female offending, which is often driven by domestic abuse. Around 400 female offenders with a history of trauma and abuse will be supported through women’s centres to settle back into community life. The pilot will offer access to housing and substance misuse support as well as facilitating contact between mothers and their children.

          Sorcha has worked as a Director of Mergers at the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) since 2019 and replaces Joel Bamford who left in February. Her appointment follows an open recruitment process that attracted applications from a strong field of candidates.

As Senior Director of Mergers, Sorcha will be the decision-maker on complex Phase 1 merger cases, as well as overseeing the merger team’s work across both Phase 1 and 2 inquiries. Following the UK’s exit from the EU, the CMA has taken on responsibility for merger cases that were previously reserved for the European Commission, which are typically larger and more complex.

Sorcha will work alongside Colin Raftery, who is also a Senior Director in the mergers team, and report to David Stewart, Executive Director for Markets and Mergers.

David Stewart, Executive Director for Markets and Mergers at the CMA, said:


  It’s a pleasure to welcome someone of Sorcha’s experience and acumen to the CMA’s senior leadership team. Everyone who works with Sorcha knows that she brings enormous strengths to our mergers work. Her analytical skill and strategic judgment will be vital in this critical role, as the CMA continues to build on its strong track record as a world-class competition authority.


On her appointment, Sorcha said:


  I’m delighted to accept this role at a time when the CMA is taking on more complex merger inquiries than ever before.

  Competition has an important role in delivering the best possible outcomes for people across the UK; this is especially important as the cost of living rises.

  I look forward to working closely with Colin, David and the rest of the CMA’s renowned mergers team as we investigate deals to ensure that they do not undermine competition and leave people worse off.


Sorcha took up her appointment on 1 April 2022. Before joining the CMA, she worked in private practice in the UK and Canada.

"124",2022-04-04,"More than 97% of offenders on sobriety tags have stayed off alcohol, a year after they were introduced in England following a successful pilot in Wales.","
    
          

more than 3,100 criminals fitted with alcohol-monitoring tags in a year
  offenders stayed sober 97% of the time
  move to cut booze-fuelled crime which costs society £21 billion


Since the tags were launched as part of government plans to curb drink-fuelled crime, 3,121 offenders have been monitored by the tags, with more than 3,000 staying sober.

Alcohol plays a part in 39 per cent of all violent crime in the UK, and the social and economic cost of drink-related harm is estimated to be around £21.5 billion per year.

As a result of the scheme’s success, the Ministry of Justice will roll out alcohol-monitoring tags to other offenders once they are released from prison in the summer. Further details will be announced in the coming months.

By 2025 it is estimated that 12,000 offenders will have had their drinking monitored by the tags – part of the Government’s £183 million expansion of electronic monitoring.

Minister of State for Crime and Policing Kit Malthouse said:


  We are ramping up our use of this innovative technology because it is working, with offenders staying sober 97 per cent of the time.

  It is not only protecting the public from the scourge of alcohol-fuelled crime - it also gives probation officers the chance to work with offenders to help them turn their lives around.


Since last April, courts have been able to order offenders to wear an alcohol tag as part of a community sentence when their crime was driven by alcohol. The tag takes a sample of their sweat every 30 minutes and alerts the Probation Service if the offender has been drinking.

Those found breaking their ban can face a prison sentence and fines.

Roughly 20 per cent of offenders supervised by the Probation Service have an alcohol problem. The service provides professional support to offenders with an alcohol misuse issue, monitoring risk and helping them address their consumption while also linking them into specialist help.

Mark*, aged 44 from Hereford, was sentenced to a Community Order, and required to wear an alcohol-monitoring tag for 90 days after being arrested for drink driving. He has also been banned from the road for 30 months and received 100 hours Community Payback.

Mark said:


  I was pulled over on a Saturday morning and was devastated to blow over the limit. Like many others, during lockdown a drink at the weekend had turned into maybe a glass of wine during the week and it made me reflect.

  I’ve not found wearing the tag hard, but it has given me extra motivation to reduce my intake.


The government is investing £183 million into the expansion of electronic monitoring. As well as sobriety devices, GPS monitoring equipment is now deployed across 19 police force areas – roughly half of England and Wales - so that burglars, robbers and thieves that have served a prison sentence of a year or more are tagged on release. Their whereabouts will be monitored by GPS satellites for up to 12 months.

*Mark is not the offender’s real name.

Notes to editors

The Alcohol Abstinence and Monitoring Requirement was launched a year ago in England following the successful launch in Wales in October 2020.
  Alcohol Monitoring on Licence was launched in Wales in November 2021 and will be rolled out to England this summer.
  The Crime Survey indicated that 39% of victims of serious offences believed that alcohol played a factor in the incident: click to read England’s survey and Wales.

"125",2022-04-03,"Pensioners and their loved ones are being urged to take-up Pension Credit, as a new campaign is launched to help those of pension age with the cost of living.","
    
          It comes as new figures show many pensioners could be missing out on Pension Credit, a vital financial boost that can be worth over £3,300 a year.

Starting this month, advertising for Pension Credit will feature in internet search results and on social media, before being expanded to national and regional newspapers.

The Department for Work and Pensions will also be distributing leaflets within local communities, while businesses can also get involved in the campaign by spreading the word to their customers using the department’s digital toolkit and encouraging them to call the claim line between the hours of 8am-6pm.

All State Pension recipients will continue to receive reminders about Pension Credit in the post as part of the department’s annual uprating communications.

Currently, over 1.4 million pensioners in Britain receive Pension Credit. However, many are still not claiming this extra financial help and it is estimated up to £1.7bn is being left unclaimed. This is why the DWP is renewing calls for all pensioners to check if they could be eligible.

Minister for Pensions Guy Opperman said:


  We recognise the challenges some pensioners will be facing with the cost of living which is why promoting Pension Credit is a priority.



  That’s why we’re calling on everyone with retired family, friends and loved ones to check in with them and see if they can get this extra financial support.


The campaign also includes tackling some of the myths that may stop people applying, such as how having savings, a pension or owning a home are not necessarily barriers to receiving Pension Credit.

It also reminds people that even a small award can provide access to a wide range of other benefits – such as help with housing costs, council tax or heating bills. For those over 75, this includes continued entitlement to a free TV licence.

Pension Credit can be claimed by phone and online, ensuring that older people can apply safely and easily, wherever they are. The online Pension Credit calculator is also on hand to help pensioners check if they’re likely to be eligible and get an estimate of what they may receive.

Caroline Abrahams, Charity Director at Age UK, said:


  Pension Credit can make a big difference if you’ve reached State Pension Age and haven’t got much money coming in. With prices rising rapidly at the moment it’s more important than ever to claim what’s rightfully yours. We urge any older person who thinks they may be eligible to put in a claim and Age UK is here to provide advice and practical support to help you with the process.



  Pension Credit is something of a well kept secret - many people have simply not heard of it. That’s a real shame because at Age UK we see how much it helps those who actually receive it. We hope this campaign is the first step in a sustained government effort to bring Pension Credit to the older public’s attention, and we warmly support it for this reason. Pension Credit is really important for older people and deserves to be much better known.


Morgan Vine, Head of Policy and Influencing at Independent Age, said: 


  We welcome this campaign to increase Pension Credit uptake. We know this support can be life-changing but for too long, too many people over 65 who are eligible have been missing out.



  Older people have told us that before receiving Pension Credit they would skip meals, struggle with a cold home and feel isolated, as they would turn down opportunities to see people because they couldn’t even afford a cup of tea in a café.



  With the cost-of-living crisis making life even more harsh for people over 65, it has never been more urgent to take action on Pension Credit. Awareness campaigns are one part of the strategic approach that is needed at this critical time, so it is very positive to see the government working with local partners to deliver awareness raising materials.



  We look forward to seeing the impact of this campaign, so that further, fast action can be taken to target those who are missing out.


Pension Credit is designed to help with daily living costs for people over State Pension age and on a low income, though you do not need to be in receipt of State Pension to receive it.

It tops up a person’s income to a minimum of £177.10 per week for single pensioners or £270.30 for couples. These amounts will rise to £182.60 per week for single pensioners and to £278.70 for couples from 11th April.

          Household Support Fund doubled to £1 billion with £500 million of new funding, as government goes further to support families with cost of living
  Six-month extension will help most vulnerable households deal with rising cost of essentials
  People can continue to access support through their Local Authority, ensuring those most in need get the help available
Today’s bolstered fund will continue to target the most vulnerable households and individuals, having helped thousands of families since its launch in September.

A third of the funding will be ring-fenced to support families with children, while another third will be dedicated to pensioners. This ensures the people who need it most will continue to receive vital support to meet essential household costs.

Using their local knowledge, Local Authorities will determine how to best use the remainder of the fund within the scope set out by ministers. Previous funding has supported households with food, clothing, energy and water costs, and this extension will ensure that this support continues through to the autumn.

Thérèse Coffey, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, said:


  We have always provided help to those who need it and extending this fund is another commitment to support people with the cost of living.



  We know the pressures many are currently facing, especially pensioners and families with children, which is why this fund targets support to the most vulnerable households across the country.


Of the £500 million, the devolved administrations will receive £79 million through the Barnett formula. This brings the total Household Support Fund allocations for the devolved administrations to £82 million for the Scottish Government, £50 million for the Welsh Government and £28 million for the Northern Ireland Executive. It will be for the devolved administrations to decide how to allocate this additional funding.

This fund is part of £22 billion of support provided in 2022-23 to help families with the cost of living and to ensure people keep more of their money. This includes changes to the Universal Credit taper rate and work allowances worth £1,000 extra on average for working families, and an increase in National Insurance thresholds. It also includes help for energy costs through a cut to fuel duty and the £9.1 billion Energy Rebate. And from tomorrow (1 April 2022), the National Living Wage will be rising to £9.50 an hour, providing a timely boost to the lowest paid.

"127",2022-03-24,"CMA Chair Jonathan Scott says competition is “more important than ever before” as concerns mount over the cost of living.","
    
          The Annual Plan explains how the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will protect consumers, promote competition and help support the economy in the year ahead. It aims to encourage innovation, productivity, and sustainable growth to benefit all nations and regions of the UK.

Jonathan Scott, Chair of the CMA, said:


  At a time of rising concern over the cost of living, competitive markets have a crucial role to play in keeping prices for consumers as low as possible. Competition will also be vital for promoting innovation, productivity and growth in our economy.

  Over the last year, we have worked tirelessly to achieve great results for people in the UK, including securing refunds for people whose holidays were cancelled; freeing people from costly ground rent clauses; and launching our first investigations to crack down on companies that make misleading green claims. Looking to the year ahead, competition will be more important than ever before, and our Annual Plan outlines our continued commitment to boosting competition and protecting consumers.


In 2022 to 2023, the CMA will focus on the following themes:

Protecting consumers from unfair behaviour by businesses, during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic
  Fostering competition to promote innovation, productivity and long-term growth right across the UK
  Promoting effective competition in digital markets
  Supporting the transition to low carbon growth, including through the development of healthy competitive markets in sustainable products and services
  Delivering our new responsibilities and strengthening our position as a global competition and consumer protection authority
During the consultation process for the draft Annual Plan, the CMA sought insight directly from consumers, representative charities, and businesses. As well as receiving 19 written submissions from organisations that overwhelmingly supported the themes set out in the plan, the CMA held meetings with stakeholders and hosted events across all 4 nations of the UK.

          1 in 2 shopping online at night drink and click
  CMA warns about sneaky sales tactics as cost of living rises
  Digitally native Gen Z first to admit they’re susceptible to online rip-offs
As the cost of living continues to increase, and with almost one-third of all retail purchases now taking place online, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has become increasingly concerned about the impact of “sneaky” sales practices on consumers.

The survey comes as part of the CMA’s new campaign The Online Rip-Off Tip-Off to help shoppers spot and avoid misleading online tactics, which could result in them being ripped off.

This latest phase of the campaign warns shoppers that such sales ploys can be even more effective at manipulating them if they shop at certain times of the day, or when they are in certain states of mind. And it advises all shoppers to be careful before they drink and click.

Initial research highlighted that misleading tactics are designed to play on behavioural biases, often without people realising that they are being manipulated. This means they can be even more effective when shoppers are distracted, hungry, or tired for example.

With 8 in 10 people who shop online late at night saying they do so, or have done so, while watching TV, and around three quarters  saying the same about listening to the radio/music (69%) or scrolling on social media (70%), this latest poll highlights how easy it is to be unwittingly misled.

The CMA also warns that no one is immune. Its survey revealed that more than a third of Gen Z, dubbed the ‘digitally native’ generation, admit to being susceptible to online rip-offs. And they are the biggest night-time online shopping spenders, splurging £290 on average last month.

George Lusty, Senior Director for Consumer Protection, explained:


  As the cost of living continues to rise, every penny we spend must count.

  We’re increasingly concerned about online businesses using sales tactics to push people into parting with their cash.

  And the time of day or mindset you’re in when shopping can make you more vulnerable to being unwittingly misled.

  Check out the CMA’s Online Rip-Off Tip-Off, which has been launched to help shoppers spot and avoid potential online rip-offs.


4 common misleading online tactics are:

Subscription traps - misleading a customer into signing up to, and paying for, an unwanted subscription that can be difficult to cancel
  Hidden charges – unexpected compulsory fees, charges or taxes being added when someone tries to make an online purchase
  Pressure selling – a tactic used to give a false impression of availability or popularity of a product or service
  Fake reviews – reviews that do not reflect an actual customer’s genuine opinion or experience of a product or service
Fronted by TV presenter and consumer champion Angellica Bell, the Online Rip-off Tip-Off campaign launched with a film depicting misleading online tactics in a real-life market, with the key message “you wouldn’t put up with it offline, so don’t do so online”. The aim of the campaign is to make consumers aware of misleading online practices, understand the negative impact they can have and provide tips on how to avoid them.

"129",2022-03-23,"The Chancellor delivered a Spring Statement today that puts billions of pounds back into the pockets of hard-working people – unveiling a new Tax Plan to ease the rising cost of living and to deliver the biggest cut to personal taxes in a quarter of a century.","
    
          
Chancellor announces tax cut for nearly 30 million UK workers through rise in National Insurance thresholds – saving the typical employee over £330 in the year from July.
  Unveiling a Tax Plan to give families further help with the cost of living, Rishi Sunak reduces fuel duty on petrol and diesel by 5p per litre for the next year – and announces a £5 billion income tax cut from 2024.
  Spring Statement also sets out measures to boost investment, innovation, and growth – including a £1,000 increase to Employment Allowance to benefit around half a million SMEs.
Rishi Sunak announced that National Insurance starting thresholds will rise to £12,570 from July, meaning hard-working people across the UK will keep more of what they earn before they start paying personal taxes.

The cut, worth over £6 billion, will benefit almost 30 million working people with a typical employee saving over £330 in the year from July. This means the UK now has some of the most generous tax thresholds in the world.

Mr Sunak also announced that fuel duty for petrol and diesel will be cut by 5p per litre from 6pm tonight (23 March) to help drivers across the UK with rising costs – a tax cut worth £2.4 billion. This is the biggest cut ever on all fuel duty rates and means a one-car family will now save on average £100.

To let people keep more of what they earn, the basic rate of income tax will also be cut by 1p in the pound in 2024, when the OBR expect inflation to be back under control, debt falling sustainably and the economy growing. The cut is worth £5 billion for workers, savers and pensioners and will be the first cut to the basic rate in 16 years.

The Chancellor also set out a series of measures to help businesses boost investment, innovation, and growth – including a £1,000 increase to Employment Allowance to benefit around half a million smaller firms.

Delivering the Spring Statement, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said:


  This statement puts billions back into the pockets of people across the UK and delivers the biggest net cut to personal taxes in over a quarter of a century.

  Like our actions against Russia, I have been able to do this because of our strong economy and the difficult but responsible decisions I have had to make to rebuild our finances following the pandemic.

  Cutting taxes means people have immediate help with the rising cost of living, businesses have better conditions to invest and grow tomorrow, and people keep more of what they earn for years to come.


Delivering the statement, the Chancellor made clear that our sanctions against Russia will not be cost-free for people at home, and that Putin’s invasion presents a risk to our economic recovery – as it does to countries all around the world.

However, announcing the further measures to help people deal with rising costs, he said the extra support could only be provided because of the UK’s strong economy and the tough but responsible decisions taken to rebuild our fiscal resilience.

The immediate help for people with the cost of living and support for businesses comes as part of a wider Tax Plan announced by the Chancellor that will also create better conditions for growth and will share proceeds from growth more fairly – ensuring people can keep more of what they earn.

Help with the cost of living

The Chancellor said that global supply chain issues following the pandemic, as well as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, are driving up the cost of living for families across the UK.

To combat this, he announced that from 6pm this evening (23 March) fuel duty will be cut by 5p per litre for 12 months – worth £2.4 billion for hard-working families across the UK.

To ease cost of living pressures for almost 30 million employees, the Chancellor announced that from July 2022, National Insurance thresholds will rise to £12,570 to align with the income tax personal allowance. This simplification means that, from July, 70% of workers who pay NICs will pay less of it, even after accounting for the Health and Social Care Levy. Of those who benefit from the threshold increase, 2.2 million people will be taken out of paying NICs altogether.

To ensure more people can keep more of what they earn for years to come, the Chancellor also announced plans to cut the basic rate of income tax from 20p to 19p from 2024. The historic £5 billion tax cut for workers, pensioners and savers will be worth £175 on average for 30 million people and will be the first cut to the basic rate in 16 years. This will be delivered in a responsible and affordable way, while continuing to meet our fiscal rules.

Mr Sunak also announced that there will be an extra £500 million for the Household Support Fund, which doubles its total amount to £1 billion to support the most vulnerable families with their essentials over the coming months. The Chancellor also reduced the VAT on energy saving materials such as solar panels, heating pumps and roof insulation from 5% to zero for five years, helping families become more energy-efficient.
This cost of living support comes on top of the measures that the Chancellor has already announced over the recent months to support families. This includes a £9 billion energy bill rebate package, worth up to £350 each for around 28 million households, an increase to the National Living Wage, worth £1,000 for full time workers, and a cut to the Universal Credit taper, worth £1,000 for two million families.

Boosting Investment, Innovation and Growth

To lift growth and productivity among UK businesses, Mr Sunak set out plans to boost private sector investment and innovation and bring in a new culture of enterprise.

He increased the Employment Allowance – a relief which allows smaller businesses to reduce their employers National Insurance contributions bills each year – from £4,000 to £5,000. The cut is worth up to £1,000 for half a million smaller businesses and starts in two weeks’ time, on 6 April. As a result, 50,000 of these businesses will be taken out of paying NICs and the Health and Social Care Levy, taking the total number of firms not paying NICs and the Levy to 670,000.

The Chancellor also announced two new business rates reliefs will be brought forward by a year to come into effect in April 2022. There will be no business rates due on a range of green technology used to decarbonise buildings, including solar panels and batteries, whilst eligible heat networks will also receive 100% relief. Together these will save businesses more than £200 million over the next five years.

Ahead of the end of the super-deduction, the government will work with businesses and other stakeholders to consider cuts and reforms to best support future investment. And with UK employers spending just half the European average on training their employees, the Chancellor said he will examine how the tax system - including the operation of the Apprenticeship Levy – can be used to encourage employers to invest in adult training.

The Chancellor committed to improving R&D reliefs too. UK business R&D investment is less than half of the OECD’s average as a percentage of GDP, so R&D tax reliefs will be reformed to deliver better value for money for the taxpayer while being more generous where they can make the most difference. The scope of reliefs will also be expanded to cover data, cloud computing and pure maths.

The support for SMEs comes on top of 50% business rates relief for eligible retail, hospitality, and leisure properties, also coming in this April and worth £1.7 billion for small businesses. The Help to Grow Management and Digital schemes, worth thousands of pounds per business, and the £1 million Annual Investment Allowance are also available to continue supporting UK businesses.

Further announcements

The Spring Statement also confirms that:

A new Efficiency and Value for Money Committee will be set up to cut £5.5 billion worth of cross-Whitehall waste – with savings to be used to fund public services.
  £50 million new funding will be provided to create a Public Sector Fraud Authority to hold departments account for their counter-fraud performance and to help them identify, seize and recover fraudsters money.
  Local residents across the UK will benefit from a fresh set of infrastructure projects as we open the second round of the £4.8 billion Levelling Up Fund. It will continue to focus on regeneration, transport and cultural investments."

Rishi Sunak announced that National Insurance starting thresholds will rise to £12,570 from July, meaning hard-working people across the UK will keep more of what they earn before they start paying personal taxes.

The cut, worth over £6 billion, will benefit 2.4 million working people in Scotland with a typical employee saving over £330 a year, whilst the typical self-employed person will save over £250. This means the UK now has some of the most generous tax thresholds in the world.

As a result of a cut to the basic rate of income tax for savings income, taxpayers in Scotland will see benefits worth £3 million. As other income tax rates are devolved in Scotland, the Scottish Government’s funding is automatically increased as a result of this tax cut as set out in the agreed Fiscal Framework. This is initially worth £350 million in 2024-25.

The Chancellor also set out a series of measures to help businesses boost investment, innovation, and growth – including a £1,000 increase to Employment Allowance to benefit around half a million businesses.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak said:


  We’re slashing taxes for millions of hard-working people in Scotland, getting pounds in people’s pockets and helping pay cheques to stretch further – from July more than 2.4 million in Scotland will get a tax cut with the typical employee keeping £330 more each year.

  By cutting fuel duty, we’re making it cheaper for people in Scotland every time they go to the pump, which together with the freeze means people save £100 per car on average a year.

  We’re boosting small business growth by increasing the Employment Allowance – a tax cut worth up to £1,000 for thousands of businesses.


Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said:


  Measures announced by the Chancellor will help address the big issues facing people in Scotland and right across the UK.

  Families across the country are struggling with the cost of living. The reduction in fuel duty, zero VAT on green home improvements, and a tax cut for low and middle earners will help them with these growing pressures.

  And an extra £45 million for the Scottish Government will allow them to provide additional support to the most vulnerable families over the coming months.

  The Chancellor also reiterated our steadfast support for the people of Ukraine. I know people across Scotland will stand with him on that.

  These are undoubtably challenging times, but action taken by the Chancellor in the Spring Statement will help the UK Government build a stronger, more secure economy for everyone.


To grow the world’s very best talent in AI, the Government will partner with industry and academia to create 1,000 new AI PhDs. The Government will invest £117m to create PHDs across the UK at Centres for Doctoral Training, building on the existing three sites in Scotland. This will train a new generation of AI researchers who will develop and use AI in areas such as healthcare, climate change and creating new commercial opportunities.

Mr Sunak also announced that the Scottish Government will receive £41 million more funding as there will be an extra £500 million for the Household Support Fund, which doubles it’s total amount to £1 billion to support the most vulnerable families with their essentials over the coming months. The Chancellor also reduced the VAT on energy saving materials such as solar panels, heating pumps and roof insulation from 5% to zero, helping families become more energy-efficient.

This cost of living support comes on top of the measures that the Chancellor has already announced over the recent months to support families.

The immediate financial support for people and businesses comes as part of a wider tax plan announced by the Chancellor that will create better conditions for growth and will share proceeds from growth more fairly – ensuring people can keep more of what they earn.

Mr Sunak also announced that the Welsh Government will receive £25 million more funding as there will be an extra £500 million for the Household Support Fund, which doubles it’s total amount to £1 billion to support the most vulnerable families with their essentials over the coming months. The Chancellor also reduced the VAT on energy saving materials such as solar panels, heating pumps and roof insulation from 5% to zero, helping families become more energy-efficient.

This cost of living support comes on top of the measures that Chancellor has already announced over the recent months to support families. This includes a more than £9 billion energy bill rebate package, worth up to £350 each for around 28 million households, an increase to the National Living Wage, worth £1,000 for full time workers, and a cut to the Universal Credit taper, worth £1,000 for 2 million families.

To grow the world’s very best talent in AI, the Government will partner with industry and academia to create 1,000 new AI PhDs. The Government will invest £117m to create PHDs across the UK at Centres for Doctoral Training, building on the  existing site in Swansea. This will train a new generation of AI researchers who will develop and use AI in areas such as healthcare, climate change and creating new commercial opportunities.

The Chancellor delivered a Spring Statement today that puts billions of pounds back into the pockets of hard-working people in Northern Ireland – unveiling a series of tax cuts to ease the cost of living.

Rishi Sunak announced that National Insurance starting thresholds will rise to £12,570 from July, meaning hard-working people across the UK will keep more of what they earn before they start paying personal taxes.

The cut, worth over £6 billion, will benefit 800,000 working people in Northern Ireland with a typical employee saving over £330 a year, whilst the typical self-employed person will save over £250. This means the UK now has some of the most generous tax thresholds in the world.

Mr Sunak also announced that fuel duty for petrol and diesel will be cut by 5p per litre from 6pm tonight (23 March) to help drivers across the UK with rising costs. Worth £2.4 billion, this is the biggest cut ever on all fuel duty rates and means a one-car family will now save on average £100.

To let people keep more of what they earn, the basic rate of income tax will also be cut by 1p in the pound in 2024 when, as the OBR currently predict, inflation and debt will be lower. The cut is worth £5 billion for workers, savers and pensioners and will be the first cut to the basic rate in 16 years.

The Chancellor also set out a series of measures to help businesses boost investment, innovation, and growth – including a £1,000 increase to Employment Allowance to benefit around half a million businesses.

The UK Government is also providing the Northern Ireland Executive with an additional £47 million through the Barnett formula next year, as a result of measures announced by the Chancellor today.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak said:


  More than 800,000 people in Northern Ireland will be hundreds of pounds a year better off thanks to our raising of the National Insurance thresholds, and from next year people in Northern Ireland will benefit from an Income Tax cut worth £140 million.

  Cuts to fuel duty will benefit people and businesses, which together with the freeze means people save £100 per car on average a year.

  We’re helping thousands of small businesses by increasing the Employment Allowance, a tax cut worth up to £1,000 a year, boosting innovation and growth.


Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis said:


  Today’s Spring Statement shows the UK Government’s commitment to delivering for people in all four corners of the UK.

  People in Northern Ireland will be feeling financial pressures which events beyond our control have placed upon us all, but decisions such as cutting fuel duty, raising the National Insurance thresholds, and increasing the Employment Allowance will help alleviate these.

  The UK Government is dedicated to seeing Northern Ireland’s potential for growth recognised and supported. I welcome the measures introduced by the Chancellor today and look forward to continuing to work to make Northern Ireland a better place to live, to work and to invest.

"133",2022-03-14,"Children of separated parents are set to benefit from changes to the Child Maintenance Service announced today (14 March 2022) as new powers are revealed.","
    
          The new powers being introduced will expand the list of companies and organisations required to provide information to the Child Maintenance Service (CMS) which will help the service trace the paying parent, calculate maintenance and enforce arrears more effectively.

To make it easier for companies to respond quickly and securely, the process is now being simplified so information can be passed on by secure digital means instead of compulsory in-person visits from CMS inspectors.

The government is also bringing forward proposals to allow all communications to be digital, which will speed up the service and make sure information is passed on to parents quickly.

Following responses from children’s charities, parents and interested organisations, the government has published the details of the new powers in its response to the consultation on the Child Maintenance Service.

DWP Lords Minister Baroness Stedman-Scott said:


  At the heart of these changes is our commitment to making sure children get the financial support they need to have the best start in life.



  We’re bringing the service into the modern age, removing barriers that can slow down cases and prevent money reaching children.



  The Child Maintenance Service collected or arranged £1 billion for children over the last 12 months, improving the lives of hundreds of thousands of children across the UK.


The CMS is set up for parents who have not been able to make a private arrangement about how their child’s living costs will be paid. Child maintenance payments help lift around 120,000 children across the UK out of poverty each year.

Plans for future changes when the legislation timetable allows will:

include unearned income in child maintenance calculations
  extinguish small volumes of very low value debt (£6.99 and under) where the maintenance calculation has ended but there remains an outstanding debt, and the value of the debt is substantially less than the cost of collecting it
  extinguish arrears where child maintenance has been deducted from a parent’s earnings and their employer has gone into administration, and the outstanding arrears can no longer be recovered."
"134",2022-03-10,"UK has “sleepwalked” into a system in which children are failing to get suitable placements in foster care and children’s homes, finds new report published today.","
    
          

Market study recommends development of national and regional bodies to support local authorities with getting suitable placements for children
  CMA also seeking to address concerns about financial stability of private children’s home providers and high profits in the sector, through financial health assessments and by boosting in-house foster care


The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched a market study into children’s social care in March 2021.

The final report, published today, found there is a shortage of appropriate places in children’s homes and with foster carers, meaning that some children are not getting the right care from their placement. Some children are also being placed too far away from where they previously lived or in placements that require them to be separated from their siblings.

This shortage also means that high prices are often being paid by local authorities, who are responsible for placing children in appropriate settings, with these costs picked up by taxpayers. The CMA’s analysis finds that the main reason for this is the fragmented system by which services are commissioned, which means that local authorities are not able to leverage their role as the purchasers of placements or to plan properly for the future.

To address these issues, the CMA is recommending that the UK Government, Scottish and Welsh Governments create or develop national and regional organisations that could support local authorities with their responsibilities in this sector. These would improve commissioning by carrying out and publishing national and regional analysis and providing local authorities and collective bodies with guidance and by supporting them to meet more placement needs in their local area.

The CMA is also concerned about the financial resilience of some private providers of children’s homes in England and Wales, particularly those financed through private equity. High levels of debt among these firms could lead to them getting into financial difficulties, which could impact the care provided to children.

To address these issues, the CMA is proposing:

a system for assessing the financial health of the most difficult to replace providers of children’s homes and providing warnings to relevant authorities if a failure is likely;
  that options are actively explored for bringing foster care in-house;
  a review of the barriers to provision of children’s homes, as well as the recruitment and the retention of care staff and foster carers.
Andrea Coscelli, Chief Executive of the CMA, said:


  The UK has sleepwalked into a dysfunctional children’s social care market.  This has left local authorities hamstrung in their efforts to find suitable and affordable placements in children’s homes or foster care.

  We have also identified issues with the financial stability of children’s home providers. It is important to manage the risk of children’s homes providers going bust and local authorities having to pick up the pieces.

  Local authorities cannot be left to face these challenges alone. There are several areas where national governments should make changes to address issues in the sector, including new financial oversight of providers and the development of new bodies to support local authorities with commissioning. With children’s social care currently being reviewed across the UK we want to see our recommendations reflected in any changes to policy.


The study looked at the provision of children’s social care in England, Scotland and Wales, across which there are over 100,000 looked-after children. The current annual cost for children’s social care services is around £5.7 billion in England, £680 million in Scotland and £350 million in Wales.

The CMA’s market study found that large private sector providers of fostering services and children homes appear to be making higher profits in England and Wales than the CMA would expect in a well-functioning market. This suggests that local authorities may be paying more for these services than they need to, particularly with fostering services, which are cheaper when run by local authorities.

The market study highlights and reflects the significant differences in the policy context for children’s social care between England, Scotland and Wales. The devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales have each committed to move away from the model of for-profit provision in children’s social care, and national organisations already exist in these nations to support local authorities. The recommendations the CMA makes will be relevant for each nation as they move through their own policy reform processes.

Notes to editors

Market studies, like this one, may lead to a range of outcomes, including recommendations to businesses in the market and to the government to change regulations or public policy.
  The children’s social care system is the subject of significant policy attention across the UK, including through the independent review of children’s social care in England, the implementation of the Promise review recommendations in Scotland and the Welsh Government’s Rebalancing care and support White Paper. The CMA’s recommendations will feed into ongoing policy reviews in the three nations in scope. In England, the CMA expects the recommendations to be considered as part of the ongoing Independent Review of Children’s Social Care, which is due to report this year. In Scotland and Wales, the CMA expects its recommendations to feed into the implementation of on-going reform proposals, including commitments to remove profit-making from the children’s social care sector.

"139",2022-01-26,"The CMA has secured improvements for Xbox online players, following concerns about Microsoft’s use of auto-renewing subscriptions for online gaming services.","
    
          The changes relate to Microsoft’s practices in relation to the automatic renewal of contracts for online gaming services. Microsoft’s Xbox Live Gold and Game Pass products allow people to access a library of games and play together online. They are offered as memberships which are often entered into on an auto-renewal basis. This means that membership is automatically rolled over at the end of each contract period and the customer charged unless they actively take steps to stop the subscription.

As part of an investigation into the online console video gaming sector the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) identified concerns about certain features of Microsoft’s auto-renewing subscriptions, in particular: whether it was clear upfront that contracts would automatically renew; how easy it was to turn off automatic renewal; and whether people may not have realised they were still paying for services they no longer used.

The CMA has secured undertakings with Microsoft which are designed to address these concerns. The improvements include:


    Better upfront information: Microsoft will provide more transparent, upfront information to help customers understand their Xbox membership – making clear, for example, that the subscription will auto-renew unless the customer turns off auto-renewal; when the subscription will auto-renew; how much it will cost; and how the customer can receive a refund after an accidental renewal
  
  
    Refunds: Microsoft will contact existing customers on recurring 12-month contracts and give them the option to end their contract and claim a pro-rata refund
  
  
    Inactive memberships: Microsoft will also contact existing customers who haven’t used their memberships for a long time but are still paying. These customers will be reminded how to stop payments, and if they continue not to use their memberships, Microsoft will ultimately stop taking further payments
  
  
    Better information about price increases: Microsoft will give clearer notifications of any future price rises, and will ensure people know how to turn off auto-renewal if they don’t want to pay the higher price
  
Michael Grenfell, Executive Director of Enforcement at the CMA, said:


  Gamers need to be given clear and timely information to make informed choices when signing up for auto-renewing memberships and subscriptions. We are therefore pleased that Microsoft has given the CMA these formal undertakings to improve the fairness of their practices and protect consumers, and will be offering refunds to certain customers.

  Other companies offering memberships and subscriptions that auto-renew should take note, and review their practices to ensure they comply with consumer protection law.



Full details of the undertakings are available on the CMA’s website.

Notes to editors

For media enquiries, contact the CMA press office on 020 3738 6460 or press@cma.gov.uk.
  Microsoft, as referred above, consists of Microsoft Limited and Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited.
  The undertakings apply to contracts between Microsoft and consumers for the supply of Xbox Live Gold, Game Pass and Game Pass Ultimate (or any online video gaming product which replaces, rebrands or includes these products) which are associated with a console and subject to auto-renewal.
  For the avoidance of doubt, the offering of these undertakings is not an admission that any person or firm has breached the law. Only a court can decide whether a breach has occurred.
  An undertaking is a voluntary agreement a firm makes to address an enforcement authority’s concerns and resolve an investigation without the need for court action.
  The key pieces of consumer protection legislation relevant to the CMA’s investigation are: the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPRs); Part 2 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (CRA); and the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 (CCRs). The CPRs contain a general prohibition against unfair commercial practices and specific prohibitions against misleading actions, misleading omissions and aggressive commercial practices. Part 2 of the CRA aims to protect consumers against unfair contract terms and notices, and requires contract terms to be fair and transparent. The CCRs regulate the information that should be provided to consumers before they make a purchase, cancellation rights for certain contracts and the use of pre-ticked boxes for additional payments.

          The review will consider whether the rules around pensionable age are appropriate, based on the latest life expectancy data and other evidence.

The Pensions Act 2014 requires government to regularly review State Pension age, and in accordance with law, this latest Review must be published by 7 May 2023.

State Pension age is currently 66 and two further increases are currently set out in legislation: a gradual rise to 67 for those born on or after April 1960; and a gradual rise to 68 between 2044 and 2046 for those born on or after April 1977. The first Review of State Pension age was undertaken in 2017 and concluded that the next Review should consider whether the increase to age 68 should be brought forward to 2037-39 before tabling any changes to legislation.

As the number of people over State Pension age increases, due to a growing population and people on average living longer, the government needs to make sure that decisions on how to manage its costs are, robust, fair and transparent for taxpayers now and in the future. It must also ensure that as the population becomes older, the State Pension continues to provide the foundation for retirement planning and financial security.

Therefore, this review will consider a wide range of evidence, for example, it will:

examine the implications of the latest life expectancy data
  provide a balanced assessment of the costs of an ageing population and future State Pension expenditure
  consider labour market changes and people’s ability and opportunities to work over State Pension age
  and develop options for setting the legislative timetable for State Pension age that are transparent and fair"

community competition launched to name new prison
  more than 600 jobs to be created in boost to Leicestershire economy
  jail part of the government’s £4 billion programme to modernise prisons and cut crime


All residents are encouraged to send in name suggestions for the new 1,700-place jail, set to open in 2023, that embrace the history and culture of the area.

Earlier this week, the government set out its strategy on how modern jails – like the one in Glen Parva - will cut reoffending and protect the public by giving prisoners the education, skills and addiction support they need to live crime-free lives.

The development is part of a £4 billion programme that will see 20,000 additional prison places created by the mid-2020s.

The site has already created 230 jobs and 16 apprenticeships during construction and when open, it is expected to offer more than 600 jobs – providing a significant boost to the local economy.

Prisons Minister Victoria Atkins, said:


  We want our new, modern prison in Glen Parva to be rooted in its community. That’s why we are extending an invitation to local people to help choose its name.

  The prison will create hundreds of jobs when open - giving a major boost to the local economy and helping to protect the public.


The names will be narrowed down to a shortlist of potential options, with a panel of local representatives deciding on the final winner.

The name must then be formally agreed by Her Majesty The Queen, the Secretary of State for Justice Dominic Raab, and the Prisons Minister.

This follows a similar competition launched in Wellingborough (Northamptonshire), where another jail is due to open early next year.

In October 2020, it was revealed that ‘HMP Five Wells’ was chosen by the local community in Wellingborough, paying homage to the five historic wells surrounding the town and which appear on its coat of arms.

Construction of the new category C prison at Glen Parva began in August 2020 and is being built on the site of the previous HMP/YOI Glen Parva, which closed in 2017.

Note to editors

The scheme to name the new prison in Glen Parva is at no cost to the taxpayer.

"142",2021-12-08,"Somerset farm business Alvis Brothers Ltd, of Lye Cross Farm, Redhill, has been ordered to pay £37,184 for polluting a tributary of the Congresbury Yeo.","
    
          The case was heard at Bristol Magistrates Court on 2 December 2021.

Alvis Brothers Ltd, who pleaded guilty to two pollution offences that happened in 2019, have a long history of environmental offending, having previously received a formal caution and warning letters from the Environment Agency.

Lye Cross Farm supplies cheese to major supermarkets including Waitrose, Marks and Spencer and Sainsbury, and exports to more than 40 countries around the world.

On 28 June 2019 an environment officer attended Lye Cross Farm following a report of slurry pollution to a tributary of the Congresbury Yeo near Cheddar.

The source of the pollution was found to be run off from a heap of farmyard manure at Lye Cross Farm.  The run off had entered a surface water drain that led to the stream, and more than half a kilometre was polluted.

Alvis Brothers Ltd built a basic bund to contain the run off, but when environment officers returned to the farm on 2 July effluent was leaking from the bund and again contaminating the watercourse.

Assessments by the Environment Agency the following week found a chronic impact on the aquatic invertebrates living downstream of the farm, whilst sensitive species, indicating a good water quality, were only found upstream.

The leak of slurry from the bund was still happening on a return to site on 31 July.

On a farm visit on 18 September, environment officers witnessed a second pollution, this time as a result of pig slurry being spread on nearby fields.  The slurry entered a field drain, discharging to the same watercourse.

In court District Judge Lynne Matthews described the offences as ‘disgraceful’ and ‘appalling’.  She said that the company should not require ‘nurse-maiding’ by the Environment Agency, given their farming experience.

Judge Matthews also said that in all the pollutions she had dealt with, offenders had not had as many slaps across the hand from the Environment Agency as in this case.

A quote on the Lye Cross Farm website says: “The Alvis Family takes the future of agriculture seriously – their livelihood depends entirely on how they look after their land and livestock. At Lye Cross Farm we practice two different methods of farming – organic and non-organic. If managed properly both are sustainable and do not damage the environment…”

Environment Agency Environment Officer, Jenny Hasell, said:

“Repeated pollution events from Lye Cross Farm have caused protracted damage to the local environment.

“We expect much better from such a large and experienced farming business, both for the environment and the local communities. If you are concerned about pollution to water or land, contact our 24-hour incident line on 0800 807060.”

    Fostering competition to promote innovation, productivity and long-term growth right across the UK
  
  
    Promoting effective competition in digital markets
  
  
    Supporting the transition to low carbon growth, including through the development of healthy competitive markets in sustainable products and services
  
  
    Delivering the CMA’s new responsibilities and strengthening its position as a global competition and consumer protection authority.
  
Jonathan Scott, Chair of the CMA, said:


  The emergence of the Omicron strain has added to the uncertainty being felt by consumers and businesses about the impact of coronavirus. In the run-up to Christmas we remain vigilant in protecting people across the UK from unfair behaviour and working to ensure their rights are protected.

  As we look to the future, and as the UK emerges from the worst effects of the pandemic, healthy competition will be more important than ever before. Competitive markets are essential to economic recovery because they create the conditions for investment and long-term growth in the UK. They drive innovation, increase productivity and create the best conditions to create sustainable jobs. What’s more, when markets aren’t competitive, prices go up, quality drops and the cost of living rises, hitting less well-off households the hardest.

  We’re keen to hear a wide range of voices on our plan for promoting competition and delivering in the interests of people and businesses around the UK in the coming year.


In 2022 to 2023, the CMA will develop and embed the significant new responsibilities that have been conferred on it, including the Digital Markets Unit (DMU) and the Office for the Internal Market (OIM). It will also help shape the UK’s future subsidy control regime by preparing for the creation of the Subsidy Advice Unit (SAU).

The CMA will expand its presence in the UK’s nations and regions, recruiting more staff in its offices in Cardiff, Belfast and Edinburgh and opening new ones in Darlington and Manchester.

The CMA plans to make the most of these new functions and the opportunities they bring to secure good outcomes for people throughout the UK, while playing a bigger role internationally to promote competition and protect consumers.

In 2022 to 2023, it will also do more to develop a deeper understanding of the issues people face, in particular those who are vulnerable. It will do more to explain its decision-making processes and commits to being an increasingly visible and vocal advocate for consumers.

The CMA’s consultation is intended to give partners, interested parties and members of the public the opportunity to provide views and comments on the CMA’s proposed Annual Plan for 2022 to 2023, and welcomes all feedback and suggestions.

For more information on the Annual Plan and how to share your views with the CMA, please visit the Annual Plan consultation page.

"144",2021-12-01,"Today, tens of thousands of low income households will get a cash boost as higher Universal Credit payments land in bank accounts for the first time.","
    
          As announced in the Autumn Budget, the taper rate – the amount that a person’s Universal Credit is reduced by as they earn more – has dropped from 63% to 55%. Simultaneously, work allowances, the amount eligible claimants can earn before their Universal Credit is reduced, have increased by £500 per year.

The changes mean people will keep more of what they earn, representing an effective tax cut worth £2.2 billion for the lowest earners.

Taken together the move will see, in total, almost two million of the lowest paid working families better off each year by an average of £1,000.

The Department for Work and Pensions has introduced the changes as quickly as possible, passing regulations last week to secure the higher payments for the lowest earners in time for Christmas.

Prime Minister, Boris Johnson said:


  It’s right that we support hard-working families, and this change will help some of the country’s lowest income families keep more of their money.

  Together with the increase in the minimum wage and our investments in skills and training, it shows this is a government committed to making work pay.



Work and Pensions Secretary, Thérèse Coffey said:


  Tens of thousands of the lowest earners will see a boost to their bank accounts today following changes to Universal Credit, meaning that people can keep more of what they earn to help with the cost of living.

  We introduced this change earlier than planned which will see up to 500,000 more households benefitting before Christmas.


Rishi Sunak, Chancellor of the Exchequer said:


  We want this to be a country that rewards work, where hard-working families get to keep more of their hard-earned cash.

  That’s why at Budget I announced changes to the Universal Credit taper rate that will see two million of the lowest paid families benefit from an effective £2bn tax cut.

  These people will get an average of £1,000 more a year – and this extra money will start appearing in their bank accounts today, just in time for Christmas.


The changes mean, for example, that a single mother of two, renting in Darlington, working a full-time job on the National Living Wage, will see her take-home income increase by £1,200 on an annual basis.

Meanwhile, a couple with two children, renting their home, where one partner works full time at the National Living Wage and the other works 16 hours a week earning the same, will be £1,800 per year better off.

Vulnerable households across the country are also able to access the £500 million Household Support Fund to help them with essentials over the coming months as the country continues its recovery from the pandemic. The devolved administrations will receive almost £80 million of the £500 million (£41 million for the Scottish Government, £25 million for the Welsh Government and £14 million for the NI Executive).

"145",2021-11-04,"A Gloucestershire fisherman who lured valuable elvers into his illegally-placed fishing net instead caught a 5-figure legal bill.","
    
          Phillip Croker, of The Oval, Gloucester, was caught fishing for elvers – baby eels – at Oldbury tidal sluice, on the tidal River Severn, on 14 March 2019.

The case was heard at Cheltenham Magistrates’ Court on 28 October 2021, when the 60-year-old was ordered to pay the Environment Agency costs of £10,425.40, a £300 fine and a £30 victim surcharge. Croker’s fishing net was also seized and destroyed.

During the evening of 14 March 2019 Environment Agency Fisheries Enforcement Officers caught Croker fishing illegally for elvers, including fishing with a net in water within 10 metres below the tidal sluice, and using a light to attract elvers into his net.

Elvers migrating from the Sargasso Sea are attracted to freshwater and gather in large numbers below the tidal gate, which controls freshwater entering the saltwater estuary at Oldbury.

When Croker was discovered, officers found around 700 grams of elvers in Croker’s net.  At the time of the offence elver prices were approximately £150 per kilogram. The elvers were released back into the Severn.

The fishing of eels on the River Severn is regulated by the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975 as amended by the Marine and Coastal Act 2009 by way of authorisation.

Anglers fishing for eels on the Severn need Environment Agency authorisation and receive a tag that must be attached to their net to show they are fishing legally.

While Croker pleaded guilty to fishing without an Environment Agency tag for his net, he denied setting up his net within 10m below a tidal sluice, fishing unaided by tying his net to the sluice gates and using a light. Magistrates found him guilty on all counts.

Richard Dearnley, Fisheries Enforcement Officer for the Environment Agency, said:


  Elver authorisations come with strict conditions aimed at preventing their over-exploitation and to encourage a fair and sustainable fishery.

  There has been a huge decline in eel stocks in recent years and their illegal exploitation undermines the Environment Agency and Sustainable Eel Group efforts to conserve and improve eel stocks.

  This offence was financially motivated to increase the likelihood of higher catches of elvers due to an unfair advantage.

  This case shows we pursue offenders through the courts and will not hesitate to take enforcement action where people flout the rules.


Anyone with information about illegal fishing activities should call the Environment Agency’s 24-hour incident hotline on 0800 807060 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Notes to editor

Offences charged:

Fishing for eels in contravention of condition 8 of the authorisation, in that he did fish with a net in waters within 10 metres below an inlet or outlet of the Oldbury Tidal Sluice.
Contrary to Section 27B(1)(b) of the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975 as amended by the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009.
  Fishing for eels in contravention of condition 5 of the authorisation, in that he did fish with a net which should not be capable of fishing unaided when both hands are removed, in that the net was tied to railings.
Contrary to Section 27B(1)(b) of the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975 as amended by the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009.
  Fishing for eels in contravention of condition 9 of the authorisation, in that he did fish without his authorisation tag attached to his instrument at all times.
Contrary to Section 27B(1)(b) of the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975 as amended by the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009.
  Using a prohibited instrument, namely a light for the purpose of taking or killing eels.
Contrary to Section 1(1)(a)(v) and Schedule 4 of the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975 as amended by the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009.
About the eel

The European eel, Anguilla Anguilla has a complex life history. It is assumed to spawn in the Sargasso Sea, which is off the Caribbean coast, but this has never been observed. Larvae hatch and drift in the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic currents towards our shores. By the time they reach the UK shores they are known as glass eels or elvers.

After the young eel has pigmented and been in the freshwater environment for a period of time it becomes what is known as a yellow eel. They remain in this state for the majority of their adult lives in fresh water (up to 35 years). Just before they begin their return journey to the Sargasso Sea their skin colour again changes, this time to a silver colour, which enables them to combat the changes from fresh to saltwater.

Eels have been exploited by man for thousands of years, initially through subsistence fisheries, and now by commercial fisheries supplying a worldwide market. They are used at all stages, from glass eels (elvers) to yellow and silver eel. The fisheries are seasonal, in the case of the elvers in the River Severn they are fished for between 1 February and 25 May.

          £500m support available to help those most in need as we enter the final stages of recovery
  Money available to councils in October 2021
  Bolsters support already in place to help vulnerable households and individuals
Vulnerable households across the country will be able to access a new £500m support fund to help them with essentials over the coming months as the country continues its recovery from the pandemic.

The new Household Support Fund will support millions of households in England and will be distributed by councils in England, who know their local areas best and can directly help those who need it most, including for example, through small grants to meet daily needs such as food, clothing, and utilities. Cash will be made available to Local Authorities in October 2021.

The Barnett formula will apply in the usual way to additional funding in England. The devolved administrations will therefore receive up to £79m of the £500m.

With more people in work and the economy bouncing back, the Government is focused on investing in jobs and skills – increasing prospects and wages across the country – whilst ensuring those in greatest need can access vital support to help cover every day costs. Alongside this, the government’s Plan for Jobs is helping people move back into employment so they can earn a regular wage, progress and increase their financial resilience.

Families will also continue to benefit from the energy price cap, recent rise in Local Housing Allowance and increases in the National Living Wage.

Thérèse Coffey, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, said:


  Over the last year, we have helped millions of people provide for their families. Many are now back on their feet but we know that some may still need further support. Our targeted Household Support Fund is here to help those vulnerable households with essential costs as we push through the last stages of our recovery from the pandemic.


Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak said:


  Everyone should be able to afford the essentials, and we are committed to ensuring that is the case.

  Our new Household Support Fund will provide a lifeline for those at risk of struggling to keep up with their bills over the winter, adding to the support the government is already providing to help people with the cost of living.


The UK Government has kept its Covid-related economic support in place until September, helping people through the toughest stages of the pandemic and well beyond the end of the roadmap, with more generous timelines than other countries in Europe.

This new fund will run over winter and those in need of support should contact their local council who will help them access the fund.

This fund bolsters support from the Warm Home Discount which provides a £140 rebate on energy bills each winter to over 2.2 million low-income households and the Cold Weather Payment which provides £25 extra a week for poorer households when the temperature is consistently below zero.

Earlier this year the government expanded the £220 million Holiday Activities and Food programme, which has offered nutritious meals and enriching activities to disadvantaged children across the Easter and Summer holidays, and will do so again this Christmas.

And to further support families with children, the Government has doubled free childcare for eligible working parents, worth up to £5,000 per child every year and increased the value of Healthy Start vouchers in April by over a third, helping disadvantaged women who are pregnant or have children under four to purchase fresh fruit and vegetables, boosting the long-term health of their children.

As the Barnett formula will apply in the usual way to additional funding in England, the devolved administrations will receive up to £79m of the £500m (£41m for the Scottish Government, £25m for the Welsh Government and £14m for the NI Executive). It will be for the devolved administrations to decide how to allocate this additional funding.

"148",2021-09-07,"Following unprecedented fluctuations to earnings caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the government has today announced legislation to set aside for one year the use of average earnings growth figures for State Pensions up-rating.","
    
          In taking this decision, the government has carefully considered the fairest approach for both pensioners and younger taxpayers.

This legislation will ensure pensioner incomes still receive a significant boost, uprating by the higher of inflation or 2.5%.

The growth in earnings is estimated to be between 8% and 8.5%. This would mean a difference of around £4 or 5 billion in basic and new State Pensions expenditure in 2022/23, when comparing with the higher of 2.5% or expected price inflation.

Younger people have been hit hardest by the financial impacts of the pandemic, and the artificial inflation of pensioner incomes at this time would be out of kilter with the pressures being experienced by the rest of the population.

This makes sure pensioners’ spending power is preserved and they’re protected from higher costs of living.

But will also ensure that as we are having to make difficult decisions elsewhere across public spending – including freezing public sector pay – pensioners are not unfairly benefitting from a statistical anomaly.

This new legislation is a one-year response to exceptional circumstances and the government plans to return the earnings element of the Triple Lock next year.

Since 2010, the full yearly basic State Pension has increased by over £2,050 in cash terms.

"149",2021-08-27,"Hackney Council built an API platform for developers to use to create APIs.","
    
          
Hackney Council built an API platform for developers to use to create APIs. The platform includes a set of API service standards and template code.

Summary

Timeframe: October 2017 to present
  Team members: For HMRC, the Head of Products (EU Exit, Integration Framework, SDES) at Enterprise Integration Services. For Hackney Council, the Corporate Information and Communications Technology (ICT) team and Development Manager
  Tools: CircleCI, Amazon Web Services (AWS), .NET Core
  API playbook
Project objective

Hackney Council wanted to build a public API platform using modern software development processes. This platform would be for developers and contain all the Hackney Council APIs, supported by a robust set of API standards. Widespread use of this platform would result in reduced development costs, better return on investment, and would enable services to develop a loosely coupled microservices architecture. That is, changes to one service would not affect other services.

The department

Hackney Council provides services such as council tax and rent payment, repair reporting and bulk waste collection to residents of the London Borough of Hackney. The Corporate Information and Communications Technology (ICT) team works with the service users and residents to identify their user needs and build effective solutions to those needs.

Researching the API platform

Although Hackney Council’s Corporate ICT team had full management support for this project, they recognised that they did not yet have the skills and knowledge to start building the platform. To start with, they spoke to HMRC about how to successfully implement a large-scale API platform in government. HMRC shared their knowledge on:

how HMRC implemented and maintained their API platform and their overall technical architecture
  how HMRC developed their API service standards
  the API-first approach to designing endpoints with user needs in mind
  what skills and capabilities Hackney Council needed to do the same
The council team also collaborated with various digital agency partners to research those partners’ API-first strategies and standards. From this, the council team realised that they needed to understand how to build APIs from both a user needs and data needs perspective. The team also researched the technology code of practice to learn about applicable best practice. Once this research was complete, the team was ready to start choosing technology before building the platform.

Choosing technology to build the API platform

From the start, Hackney Council’s Corporate ICT team took an iterative approach to choosing the technology to build the API platform depending on the user and data needs. They looked at each solution’s benefits and drawbacks and changed their approach as necessary.

For example, after evaluating both Google Cloud and AWS cloud platforms, the team chose AWS. Hackney Council felt AWS suited their needs more, as it is very developer-friendly due to the variety of services provided. Additionally, the pre-existing relationship with HMRC helped, as the HMRC delivery manager was able to set up meetings between the council team and AWS to answer questions. For example, the council team spoke with the AWS Solution Architecture team to make sure the council team were following the 5 pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

The team also made technology choices based upon their existing skills. The team of developers already had knowledge of .NET Core programming language skills, so they decided to build the platform using that language.

At the same time, the team learned from their digital agency partners about:

AWS practices around API development
  how different types of API (platform and service) would be appropriate for different use cases, depending on data and reusability needs
The team was then ready to start building the platform.

Building the API platform

Hackney Council’s corporate ICT team started building the API platform. This work included the public API platform and an API implementation guide with a set of API service standards. There were several challenges. The platform had to support:

both modern APIs and the council’s legacy applications, which were not built on database or data quality principles
  highly available, scalable and secure APIs in a loosely coupled microservices architecture, meaning that changes to one service would not affect other services
Additionally, the Corporate ICT team needed to:

understand the different user and data needs and make sure the platform served both of those types of needs
  agree on the API standards for both reusable and service-specific APIs and the standards’ criteria
  upskill themselves quickly to build the platform to the required standard by working closely with their digital agency partner
  educate their users on the difference between reusable platform APIs and non-reusable service APIs and how reusable APIs would work, because historically, most API development happened in silos and there was no API reuse
Solving challenges when building the API platform

The team used an AWS PostgreSQL database architecture to make the APIs highly available, scalable, secure, and loosely coupled. To increase security, the team used token authentication through Google Groups instead of API keys. Additionally, the team built a developer hub to collect all the APIs together to make onboarding of external developers easier.

The API playbook that the team delivered was central to overcoming the challenge of educating users. This playbook:

defines platform and service APIs and states the advantages of platform APIs
  defines API service standards for APIs to meet so those APIs can go live
  provides a template for developers to use when creating APIs, including pre-existing base code to get an API up and running quickly
This playbook was a valuable resource for getting developer buy-in to the API-first strategy as a platform. Developers could see the playbook was a single source of all the information needed to develop and maintain platform APIs. This buy-in was important to embedding the API-first strategy in the service development process.

Throughout the build process, the team led architecture and data meetups, where they asked external digital agencies and internal developers for feedback. This open and collaborative process made sure the:

platform and API playbook met both user and data needs
  API standards were fit for purpose
The team also used these meetups to emphasise to stakeholders that reusing APIs would save on development costs and provide a return of investment on the API platform.

Result of Hackney Council’s API platform

Hackney Council’s API platform went live in January 2019. The council team won an iNetwork award for API services, and the team were finalists at the AWS awards for City on Cloud. This platform brought both tangible and intangible benefits.

By working in the open and collaborating with multiple digital agencies, the team embedded an API-first strategy within service development, which saved time and money in the development process.

Since the platform went live, developers have been able to create APIs much more quickly and consistently by:

using the API playbook
  reusing existing APIs such as the Person or Contact Details APIs
Additionally, the wider developer community (including both Hackney Council and external developers) now recognises the value of working in the open, of collaboration, and of having defined API standards.

The developer community also has regular data and architecture meetups to build the community of practice for robust and secure platforms. Hackney Council iterates their API playbook once a year, and they released a new version in May 2021. In future, the API playbook will have a distribution list to alert users when the team publishes a new playbook.

"150",2021-08-20,"Expansion of Clink Kitchens Scheme to help thousands of offenders find jobs and turn their backs on crime.","
    
          

The Clink Kitchens expected to open at 25 prisons by the end of the year
  Scheme reduces reoffending rates by almost a third, helping to keep streets safe


Thousands of offenders will be steered away from a life of crime thanks to the roll-out of The Clink training kitchen scheme to 25 jails by the end of the year, Prisons Minister Alex Chalk has announced.

Already running at eight prisons including HMPs Bristol, Downview, and Styal, the programme sees prisoners train in professionally-run prison kitchens for up to 35 hours a week – preparing and cooking thousands of meals daily – while simultaneously working towards professional qualifications which will help them find employment on the outside.

The Clink has already helped over 2,500 offenders into stable and secure jobs since launching just over a decade ago through their training initiatives, with the expansion announced today expected to support a further 2,000 prisoners into employment.

In 2019 alone, The Clink trained up over 440 prisoners – a total of 330,000 training hours – with over 280 employers across the country taking on Clink graduates upon release from prison.

Research shows that ex-offenders in work are more likely to turn their backs on crime for good, with prisoners who have taken part in The Clink’s training scheme almost a third less likely to go on to commit further offences – reducing the £18 billion a year cost of reoffending and keeping communities safe.

Prisons Minister, Alex Chalk, said:


  Prisoners with a job on release are far less likely to reoffend – meaning if we can provide the path to employment, we can make our communities safer.

  As we continue to build back safer from the pandemic, it is absolutely vital that we continue to address the root causes of crime by supporting offenders to turn their lives around – and this scheme will do precisely that for thousands of ex-prisoners.


The Clink Chief Executive, Christopher Moore, said:


  The roll-out of The Clink Kitchens project over the next three years to 70 prisons in England and Wales, will enable us to continue to repair society and support the hospitality industry that has a major skills shortage.

  Social mobility is at the heart of many companies’ recruitment agenda and employing a highly trained Clink graduate not only is a benefit to their business but increases the diversity of their workforce.


The partnership with The Clink Charity is one of many government schemes aimed at supporting offenders into employment with the ultimate aim of cutting crime. Other initiatives include work placements for dozens of offenders during the construction of HMP Five Wells (Northamptonshire) and the new prison in Glen Parva (Leicestershire).

Boosting access to work and safe accommodation for prison leavers will also help build back safer communities by cutting crime and reducing reoffending.

Notes to editors

The 19 prisons anticipated to be operational by the end of the summer are:  HMPs Bristol, Brixton, Bronzefield, Bullingdon, Channings Wood, Dartmoor, Downview, Eastwood Park, Erlestoke, Exeter, Forest Bank, Guys Marsh, High Down, Highpoint, Hollesley Bay, Leeds, Lewes, Liverpool, Low Newton, Moorland, New Hall, Northumberland, Peterborough, Preston, Styal, and Wealstun.
  Justice Data Lab figures show the rate of reoffending for prisoners who participated in the scheme was 15%, compared to 22% for those who did not. This is a difference of 32%.
  Over the next 3 years the New Futures Network, a specialist part of HMPPS which works to create employment opportunities for serving prisoners and prison leavers, will support The Clink Charity to deliver their sector-led training programme.

"152",2021-07-30,"Natural England has launched a new scheme in Yorkshire to help conserve local populations of great crested newts while promoting sustainable development","
    
          The scheme helps developers avoid costly delays and uses conservation payments to create new habitats for the protected species
This week an innovative new scheme to protect newts and promote sustainable development has been rolled out across Yorkshire.

Great crested newts have seen dramatic declines in their populations over the last 60 years despite being legally protected. The new ‘District Level Licensing’ scheme better protects this orange-bellied amphibian by using conservation payments from developers to create new ponds in locations that will benefit the species.

The scheme also benefits local people and authorities by avoiding costly delays for developers, helping to ensure homes are built and local authorities can deliver their plans.

The scheme will create a network of ponds across Yorkshire providing vital habitat for our biggest native newt, helping to join up sometimes isolated populations and helping them to thrive.

This week, District Level Licensing for Newts launched across seven local authority areas in North East Yorkshire: Ryedale, Scarborough, York, Selby, North York Moors National Park, Hambleton, and Redcar and Cleveland.

This means the new scheme is now available across Yorkshire and the whole of North East England. Developers in Yorkshire have already expressed interest in joining the scheme.

Craig Thomas, Natural England Natural England’s District Level Licensing Customer Relations Adviser, said:

“District level licensing is transforming a difficult planning process into one that is a real conservation success story.

“The rollout of this scheme in Yorkshire represents a win-win for both local developers and the future of this iconic species. It’s a fantastic example of working in partnership at a landscape scale and bringing improved conservation outcomes for our largest native newt - helping local populations to expand and link up across North East England. What’s more, the approach can also help meet our ambitions to build back greener.”

Alongside local authorities, Natural England is working in partnership with the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust, Wildscapes and Tees Valley Wildlife Trust to create and maintain habitat for great crested newt which would otherwise be threatened by development.

Previously, developers had to apply for a mitigation licence before building on or around the places where newts live. Seasonal restrictions on work in places where the newts were present led to delays and uncertainty over the costs and scheduling of planned development. This new ‘landscape-scale’ licensing approach is better for both developers and newts. It provides a faster and more straightforward process than the traditional approach to licensing while helping to provide more homes for newts.

Thirty seven new ponds have already been created or restored for great crested newts, and together with our partners Natural England are already working on over one hundred more new ponds across Yorkshire. This new habitat will be monitored and looked after by our local, expert partners for 25 years – all funded by the initial payment.

Jeremy Garside, Chief Executive, Tees Valley Wildlife Trust said:

“We’re really pleased to be working with Natural England on this scheme. Our Wildlife Trust is already working with farmers and landowners who are committed to restoring habitats for other protected species such as water vole and barn owl; it is great to have this new opportunity to create newt ponds as well.

“Having witnessed a steady loss of ponds from the landscape over past decades, it is heartening to see this trend reversed and while ponds will be carefully designed to benefit great crested newts, we know that they will be of huge benefit to a much wider range of threatened wildlife species and will help to build networks of habitats which aid nature’s recovery.”

You can apply to join a district level licensing scheme to manage great crested newt populations if you are developing land on .gov.uk at: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/great-crested-newts-district-level-licensing-schemes.

More about district level licensing in Yorkshire

Yorkshire is the latest area to launch a district level licensing scheme. This innovative, strategic approach to licensing is now available and being used by developers across 157 local authorities.
  This new licensing approach to authorising development affected by great crested newts is part of a larger programme to reform protected species licensing by focusing conservation effort where it will create maximum benefit. It aims to leave the environment in a better state than before.
  Previously, licences were only granted on a site-by-site basis. This missed opportunities to manage populations of great crested newts on a landscape scale and resulted in habitat for newts being squeezed around development, sometimes in disconnected patches.
  As part of the District Level Licensing project, Natural England has completed the largest ever survey of its type for great crested newts across England, funded by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. The data is open and has been published to ArcGIS Online and is available at Data.gov.uk.
  Individual site-by-site mitigation licences are still available; since 17 February 2020, there is now a charge for these licences. In areas where there is a District Level Licensing scheme, joining a scheme will be the quickest option to enable development that affects great crested newts.

"154",2021-06-15,"The Lord Chancellor shares his views on how tailored prisoner education can help us to build back a better and safer country for all.","
    
          As Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, I spend every day immersed in the inner workings of the criminal justice system. After almost 2 years in the job, there is one statistic that continues to spur me on to do better.

Every year repeat offending costs society about £18 billion. That is a staggering figure and one we should never be prepared to accept. As we begin to recover from a global pandemic, it is a price we can ill afford to pay.

While I’m proud of this government’s work to see offenders punished for their wrongdoing, I’m acutely aware that releasing prisoners without finding solutions to help ensure they turn their lives round will ultimately result in more crime, greater harm to victims and an increased economic cost to society.

We know that education can play a huge role in cutting crime. Figures published in 2017 showed prisoners who undertook study during their sentence were 9 per cent less likely to go on to commit further crimes compared to those who didn’t. When individuals are equipped with skills needed to find jobs and contribute to society, they are better placed to accomplish this once released.

I have seen for myself how education changes lives. As a barrister, part-time judge and now as Lord Chancellor, I have too often seen people with conditions such as autism and dyslexia struggle through the criminal justice system. I know from my own family experience how difficult it is to get a proper diagnosis of these conditions. As chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Autism when I was a backbencher, I campaigned hard for better awareness and provision.

The same can be said for victims with neurodivergent conditions who may also find the justice system daunting. The new Victims’ Code, which came into effect last month, outlines the minimum level of information and service victims can expect at every stage of the justice process. It also provides enhanced rights for those with impaired social functioning, including special measures to help them to give evidence in court.

I have also had the privilege to see how much those with neurodivergent conditions like these have to offer with the right help and support — which is why I’m determined to make huge strides towards improving the education on offer inside our prison system, so that it better supports those with diverse learning needs.

We need to ensure all prisoners, including those with life-long learning conditions, get the help they need to engage with their rehabilitation and reduce their chances of reoffending.

This makes even more sense when we consider the fact that at least a third of all offenders in England and Wales have a learning disability or challenge, compared with an estimated 2 per cent of the population.

Creating a system that allows every offender to get the help they need will not just make our country fairer, it will also ease the financial burden inflicted on the law-abiding majority of the public by a criminal minority.

Today (15 June 2021), I can announce plans for an overhaul of the education on offer for prisoners with learning needs, which will be led by a team of educational specialists with experience in supporting those with neurodivergent conditions.

Crucially the team will identify prisoners with learning needs such as autism and dyslexia far quicker, so that we will know where to target improved education and training, which will be delivered using new and innovative methods of teaching.

If we are serious about rehabilitating neurodivergent offenders, then it is vital that we do this, so that we can fully understand the support they may need to get their lives back on track. It will then be up to them to put in the work.

My own family experience has taught me a huge amount about what it can be like for people with neurodivergent conditions to navigate a world that too often fails to understand their needs.

We can make a huge difference by setting those with similar conditions in the criminal justice system on the right path to better lives. In the long run I believe it can help us to build back a better and fairer country — one with fewer victims and safer streets.

This will be an investment in our future and a price worth paying.

Scheme to help local young people and key workers on to the housing ladder launches near Bolsover
  ‘Own Your Home’ campaign launched to highlight the support available to get people on to the housing ladder.


Discounted houses for local people and key workers will be made available as a new housing scheme launches today (4 June 2021).

The First Homes scheme will help local first-time buyers – many of whom will be key workers like NHS staff and veterans – onto the property ladder by offering homes at a discount of at least 30% compared to the market price.

That same percentage will then be passed on with the sale of the property to future first-time buyers, meaning homes will always be sold below market value – benefitting local communities, key workers, and families for generations to come.

The scheme will support local people who struggle to afford market prices in their area, but want to stay in the communities where they live and work.

The first First Homes properties went on the market today as part of the first phase of an early delivery project in the Bolsover district, East Midlands, with the Housing Secretary in attendance.

Further sites are set to launch across the country in the coming weeks. A further 1,500 will enter the market from the autumn, with at least 10,000 homes a year being delivered in the years ahead and more if there is demand.

Delivery of the scheme is part of the government’s wider pledge to build one million new affordable and attractive homes in this Parliament and help put home ownership within reach for people across the country.

Major high-street lenders Halifax and Nationwide Building Society, along with local building societies and community lenders, announced that they will be offering high loan-to-value mortgages against First Homes to support the roll-out of the scheme.

First Homes follows on from the 95% mortgage guarantee scheme which helps first-time buyers secure a mortgage with just a 5% deposit and the government’s ‘Own Your Home’ campaign showcasing the range of flexible home ownership options available.

The campaign highlights the support available to help make home ownership a realistic and affordable option for more people than ever.

Broadcast, digital and radio adverts are showcasing the range of government schemes available to aspiring home-owners to help them get their foot on the housing ladder.

First-time buyers can find the right scheme for them via the Own Your Home website which provides a single gateway for all routes to home ownership.

The website is an easy and accessible way for first-time buyers to start their home ownership journey and find the right government scheme for them.

Housing Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:


  Enabling more people to buy their own homes is at the heart of the mission of this government, and First Homes will offer a realistic and affordable route into home ownership for even more people who want to own their own home.

  Thanks to First Homes, we will offer more homes to local people and families, providing a route for first-time buyers to stay in their local areas rather than being forced out due to rising prices.

  First Homes will also support our fantastic key workers who are looking to get their first foot on the housing ladder – from front-line doctors and nurses to delivery drivers and supermarket staff – by giving many of them the chance to buy a home at a 30% discount.

  These homes will be locked in for perpetuity to first-time buyers and key workers from their local area – making them an asset to both their owners and the wider local community.


Tim Beale, CEO of Keepmoat Homes, said:


  We are delighted to be working with our partners in government, Homes England and Bolsover District Council, to launch the First Homes scheme which is specifically designed to support first time buyers and keyworkers and help them take their first steps on the property ladder.

  Keepmoat Homes is one of the UK’s leading home-builders for first time buyers so it is great to be part of this initiative which will help even more people realise their dream of owning their own home. This is a true example of how working in partnership helps to support local people and communities.


David Postings, CEO of UK Finance, said:


  Key workers have kept the country running during the pandemic and we are committed to doing what we can to help them, and other local first-time buyers across England, to realise their dreams of owning their own homes.

  Our commitment is shared across all necessary stakeholders, as underscored by the high level of co-operation between lenders, government, local authorities and developers in helping drive the First Homes scheme forward.


Robin Fieth, Chief Executive of the Building Societies Association, said:


  Building societies have always been dedicated to bringing home ownership within reach for as many people as possible, which is why we are working with the sector to help bring forward mortgages for First Homes as soon as possible.

  Building societies, both large and small, are pleased to be among the first lenders to offer mortgages in support of this new product.


Councils will also be able to prioritise the homes for key workers such as nurses and teachers who have been looking to get on the housing ladder while supporting their community throughout the pandemic.

Each individual local authority can set a local connection test to determine who should be prioritised for the scheme based on the needs’ of their communities.

"157",2021-06-03,"Thousands of vulnerable people, including care leavers, will get more cash to pay their rent, thanks to changes to housing benefits.","
    
          These changes are coming into force from Monday 31 May 2021 – two years earlier than scheduled.

This will offer £10 million of additional housing support, bringing the total projected government spend on housing support to £30 billion this year.

Increases to the Shared Accommodation Rate (SAR) are expected to benefit thousands of Universal Credit and Housing Benefit claimants, and have been introduced more than two years earlier than the original implementation date of October 2023.

The SAR is applied to renters aged under 35 claiming support through Local Housing Allowance (LHA). It adjusts their benefit to the cost of renting a room in shared accommodation, but there is a higher, one-bedroom rate for people who need to rent solo housing.

Changes to the Local Housing Association rate
There are two key changes:

Care leavers can now claim the higher one-bedroom LHA rate for longer, as the maximum age limit has been raised to 25, from 22.
  Anyone who has lived in a homeless hostel for 3 months or more, regardless of age, will also now be able to claim the higher rate, as the age limit has been removed.
For example, in Harlow and Stortford a single care leaver aged 23 could expect to receive up to £387 additional housing support per month as a result of the change.

Minister for Welfare Delivery Will Quince said:


  These changes are an immediate boost for some of the most vulnerable young people in our communities.



  We know that having a safe, secure home is vital to getting on your feet and often into work. By bringing these changes in early, we’re able to help more people right now, as we all look to recover from the pandemic.

"158",2021-06-03,"More than 1,000 new trainee probation officers have been recruited to bolster the vital work the Probation Service does to cut crime and protect the public, meeting a government target set last July.","
    
          

Probation Service recruits record 1,000 trainees in past year
  staffing boost will improve supervision of offenders and help cut crime
  further 1,500 to be recruited this year as services are unified


The 1,007 new recruits, a record number for a single year in the history of probation, will allow staff to keep an even closer eye on offenders, including the most dangerous, and prevent more people from becoming victims. That record is set to be smashed again this year, with a further 1,500 by March next year, thanks to an extra £310 million invested in the service over the last 2 years.

Probation officers supervise offenders leaving prison on licence and those serving community sentences. They protect the public by meeting regularly with offenders and ensuring they are complying with the conditions of their release from prison or sentence and not committing crime. The use of location-tracking GPS tags and close work with the police helps them to do this. They also ensure offenders  access services that reduce the risk of them committing more crime , including drug or alcohol treatment, accommodation and education.

Where offenders have been released from prison and breach their conditions or commit further offences, probation officers have the power to recall them back to prison, helping to cut crime and protect the public.

Increased staffing in the Probation Service means  probation officers will be able to supervise fewer offenders, and be better able to use their professional skills and legal powers to help stop offenders from committing more crime.

Prisons and Probation Minister Alex Chalk said:


  Probation officers are unsung crime fighters, sending offenders back to prison if they breach their licence conditions, and helping others turn their lives around so that they don’t commit more crime.

  These new recruits are a key part of our plan to make the country safer, alongside 20,000 more police officers, tougher sentences and the building of 18,000 new prison places.


Public safety will be boosted further later this month when the supervision of low and medium risk offenders comes back under public sector control, meaning that probation officers will be able to devote more time to the most high-risk offenders.

With reoffending accounting for around 80% of all recorded crime, these improvements to the service are designed to prevent thousands of people becoming victims each year and save some of the £18 billion annual cost of repeat offending.

As well as increasing the total number of probation officers in training, nearly 1 in 5 new recruits are from an ethnic minority, demonstrating that a crime-fighting career in the probation service is open and welcoming to all.

The Probation Service is working closely with experts in the charity sector who provide specialist services aimed at cutting crime. Last month it was announced that almost £200 million will be provided to charities and organisations across the country to deliver important  services to help offenders turn their backs on crime.

Services to provide specialist housing, employment and training support to reduce reoffending
  Multi-million-pound contracts awarded to more than 25 organisations
  Providers to work with Probation Service to rehabilitate offenders and cut crime


The investment of an initial £195 million has been awarded to 26 organisations across England and Wales to provide vital support services that help reduce reoffending, such as employment and housing advice. This includes over £45 million awarded to services tailored to female offenders to address their specific needs and the underlying causes of their crimes as part of the Government’s pledge to see fewer women go to prison. The total funding awarded could rise to £270 million if contracts with these organisations are extended to their full terms.

By tackling the drivers of crime and getting offenders’ lives back on track, these services will help to prevent thousands of people becoming victims each year and save some of the £18 billion annual cost of repeat offending.

The move is one of the improvements being made to the Probation Service next month as responsibility for supervising low- and medium-risk offenders comes back under public sector control.  The delivery of unpaid work in community sentences and behavioural change programmes are also being brought back in-house.

Prisons and Probation Minister Alex Chalk said:


  Tackling things like homelessness, unemployment and illiteracy is vital to our drive to cut crime but these issues cannot be solved by our brilliant probation staff alone.



  The expertise and support of charities and companies like those we are funding today plays a crucial role in helping offenders to rehabilitate and lead a crime-free life.


Almost £46 million has been awarded to charities which provide wraparound support to women in the criminal justice system, acknowledging the complex array of issues female offenders particularly face. Organisations including The Nelson Trust, Women in Prison, and a partnership between the St Giles Trust and the Wise Group will work with vulnerable women to help them get their lives back on track. This significant investment provides long-term support to women’s centres and other dedicated services for women serving community sentences or leaving prison.

Prison leavers are around 50 per cent more likely to reoffend if released with nowhere to stay so over £33 million will be shared by charities helping the homeless, including St Mungo’s, Shelter and NACRO. Their work will help get offenders off the streets into stable accommodation and work alongside the Probation Service’s new temporary accommodation service.

A further £33 million has been awarded to companies such as Seetec, Maximus and Ingeus which provide offenders with skills training and employment support. With their expertise in helping people find work they will partner with probation staff and the New Futures Network in the Prison Service to support offenders into jobs.

Up to £118 million has been awarded to organisations which work with offenders to address personal issues, including Catch 22, The Forward Trust and The Growth Company. This ranges from support accessing mental health services to help with managing complex family relationships.

The funding has been awarded through a new process designed to make it easier for charities and other third-sector organisations to access funding from Government and around two-thirds of the funding has been awarded to registered charities. In addition, many lead organisations are using the specialist skills of smaller organisations to help deliver services, with another 50 organisations, mostly in the voluntary sector, in their supply chains.

Notes to Editors

Women’s and personal support services have been procured at Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) level, while each provider for Education, Training and Employment services will work across one of the twelve probation regions in England and Wales. Accommodation services will also be provided at a regional level except in Wales where they have been procured at PCC level.
  For the first time, the Probation Service is jointly commissioning the full range of rehabilitative services in Greater Manchester with the region’s Combined Authority from July 2021. In London, women’s services will be commissioned jointly with the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC) by providing funding to MOPAC’s existing providers for an extension and expansion of the current service. A new commissioning process will be undertaken for services from 2022.

"160",2021-05-13,"A young farmer from Leicestershire has become the 300,000th homeowner to use the Help to Buy: Equity Loan Scheme since its launch in 2013.","
    
          Sam Legg, 19, from Asfordby, bought the 300,000th Help to Buy home and is now urging others to join the government scheme.

The official Help to Buy statistics released today (13 May 2021) reveal:

313,043 households have now bought a home with the support of the Help to Buy: Equity Loan Scheme since its launch in 2013
  In the 3 months up to December 2020, there were 21,026 completions, the highest quarterly annual total ever and 40% higher than the same period in 2019
  Most of the home purchases in the Help to Buy: Equity Loan scheme were made by first-time buyers, accounting for 257,520 (82%) of total purchases
Housing Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:


  Helping people get a foot on the housing ladder is central to the mission of this government.

  Today’s figures show over 300,000 homes have been sold through our Help to Buy scheme which hugely benefits first time buyers. Alongside other measures such as the stamp duty cut and new mortgage guarantee scheme, Help to Buy will continue to help more and more people to have a home that is truly their own.


Chair of Homes England Peter Freeman said:


  Today’s milestone underlines how successful the scheme has been in helping people buy their own home. With the original Help to Buy scheme, and the new scheme aimed specifically at first time buyers, we look forward to helping more people like Sam achieve their dream of home ownership.


Sam Legg is Help to Buy’s 300,000th customer having recently bought his first home in Asfordby, Leicestershire living with his girlfriend Megan and dog Del Boy.

Sam, who works as a farmer locally, said:


  I am very happy to have bought my first home which would not have been possible without Help to Buy. The whole process went very smoothly, and I hope many more people can be helped to buy their first home in the same way.


The new Help to Buy: Equity Loan for first time buyers started on 1 April and will continue to increase the supply of new homes over the next two years and help thousands more people own their home.

The government recently announced a further two-month extension for Help to Buy customers following delays caused by the pandemic. The extension will run to 31 May, allowing homebuilders to complete the build and buyers to legally complete their purchase.

Purchasers can borrow up to 20% of the cost of a new build (40% in London), funding the balance via a mortgage and repaying the loan when they sell.

    Four-month notice periods for most tenants until at least end of September
  
  
    Move will ensure renters are protected as we continue through the Roadmap
  


Renters will continue to be supported as national COVID-19 restrictions ease, with longer notice periods in place until at least October, Housing Minister Christopher Pincher announced today (12 May 2021).

Thanks to the success of the vaccine programme and the public efforts to suppress the virus, the nation is now progressing cautiously through the Roadmap, and emergency measures for renters introduced during the pandemic will be brought in line with this.

As part of a phased approach, notice periods – previously extended to 6 months as an emergency measure during the pandemic – will be set at 4 months from 1 June. This will offer tenants continued protection throughout Step 3 and into Step 4, which will begin from 21 June at the earliest.

Subject to the public health advice and progress with the Roadmap, notice periods will return to pre-pandemic levels from 1 October.

The current ban on bailiff-enforced evictions, introduced as an emergency measure during lockdown, will end on 31 May. Bailiffs have been asked not to carry out an eviction if anyone living in the property has COVID-19 symptoms or is self-isolating.

The measures will ensure renters continue to be protected with longer notice periods for the coming months, while allowing landlords to access justice – 45% of private landlords own just one property and are highly vulnerable to rent arrears.

Extensive financial support remains in place to help people meet their outgoings, including the furlough scheme and the Universal Credit uplift, which have both been extended until the end of September.

Housing Minister, Rt Hon Christopher Pincher MP said:


  From the beginning of the pandemic, we have taken unprecedented action to protect renters and help keep them in their homes.

  As COVID restrictions are eased in line with the Roadmap out of lockdown, we will ensure tenants continue to be supported with longer notice periods, while also balancing the need for landlords to access justice.

  Crucial financial support also remains in place including the furlough scheme and uplift to Universal Credit.


Courts will continue to prioritise the most serious cases, such as those involving fraud or anti-social behaviour, with many of the evictions waiting to be enforced when the ban lifts predating the pandemic.

This week the government announced that a white paper will be published in the autumn that will set out proposals to create a fairer private rented sector that works for both landlords and tenants.

This includes proposals for the abolition of Section 21 ‘no fault’ evictions to give tenants greater security and a new ‘lifetime deposit’ to ease the burden when moving house.

    Consultation on new code of practice to assess external walls and cladding systems
  
  
    Will ensure assessments are carried out to a high and consistent standard
  
  
    Building owners to receive consistent advice on whether remediation of external walls is necessary
  


Residents and building owners are set to benefit from a new code of practice for professionals assessing buildings’ external walls and cladding systems.

As part of ambitious reform of the building sector, the government has commissioned the British Standards Institution (BSI) to draft a new code of practice for assessors when examining external walls and cladding.

This will ensure external wall assessments are carried out to a high and consistent standard, giving building owners clarity on the fire risk of the construction of external walls.

The code of practice will help professionals provide consistent, risk-based and proportionate advice on whether remediation of the external walls is necessary.

Building Safety Minister Lord Greenhalgh said:


  As part of the biggest improvements to building safety standards in 40 years, we are taking firm action to ensure homes and buildings are safer.

  This includes investing over £5 billion to help protect hundreds of thousands of leaseholders from the cost of replacing unsafe cladding on their homes.

  I welcome the launch of this consultation on a new code of practice, commissioned by government, which will ensure greater clarity and consistency for those completing assessments of external walls and a clear steer on where remediation is, or is not, required.


Scott Steedman, Director-General of Standards at BSI said:


  BSI, in its role as the UK National Standards Body, has opened a public consultation on the proposed new code of practice to support building professionals to undertake fire risk appraisals and assessments of the external wall construction of existing multistorey, multi occupied residential buildings.

  We welcome all comments on the draft standard, especially from people living or working on or in these types of buildings, including residents and people from the construction, fire, housing and safety industries.

  The consultation closes on 20 May 2021 and we aim to publish the standard in the autumn, after all comments have been reviewed by the expert steering group.


Mark Hardingham, National Fire Chiefs Council Chair said:


  We welcome this consultation on the new draft code of practice for assessors when examining external walls and cladding.

  To ensure that a wide range of views are considered before it is finalised, we want to encourage interested stakeholders to engage with it over the next few weeks.

Hong Kong BN(O) status holders and their families who settle in the United Kingdom will receive £43 million dedicated support package
  12 welcome hubs will help families and individuals access housing, education, and employment to build a life in the UK
  Funding for councils to provide additional help for new arrivals where needed, including support with housing costs and learning English
  Schools to receive dedicated Hong Kong educational resources to teach pupils about historic Hong Kong-British connection


British National (Overseas) families coming to the United Kingdom on the Hong Kong BN(O) route will benefit from a dedicated package of support to help them settle successfully into life in the UK, the Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick announced today (8 April 2021).

Backed by over £43 million, the Hong Kong British Nationals (Overseas) Integration Programme will help status holders access housing, work and educational support to ensure they are able to quickly integrate and contribute to their newfound communities.

The move delivers on the UK’s historic and moral commitment to the people of Hong Kong who chose to retain their ties to the UK by taking up BN(O) status in 1997. It provides them with a pathway to live in the UK should they choose to do so. BN(O) status holders have had their rights and freedoms restricted by the National Security Legislation imposed by the Chinese government and it is right that we change the entitlements in the UK which are attached to their status.

Councils in England, who are already playing a key role to ensure BN(O) status holders are warmly welcomed and supported, will benefit from £30.7 million to provide targeted support for new arrivals, covering additional English language and support with housing costs for those who need it. As the areas of support covered by these funds are both devolved policies, £5.8 million will be provided to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to deliver similar activity.

A further £5 million will be used to establish 12 virtual welcome hubs across every region in England, and in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to co-ordinate support and give practical advice and assistance in applying for school places, registering with GPs and even setting up businesses.

Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said:


  I want to extend a warm welcome to Hong Kongers arriving in the UK and reaffirm that this government is doing everything in its power to ensure your success and happiness here.

  This programme will ensure British National (Overseas) status holders and their families have the very best start as soon as they arrive, and support to help them find a home, schools for their children, opportunity and prosperity.

  We are a champion of freedom and democracy and will live up to our responsibilities to the people of Hong Kong, so that these families will come to find the UK a place they can call home.


Home Secretary Priti Patel said:


  We promised to uphold freedom for the people of Hong Kong, which is why I am proud that we have been able to support so many people when they have needed our help.

  It’s an unprecedented and generous scheme and there is no other visa in the world of this nature. We are working hard to successfully resettle people here and recognise there is nothing more difficult than leaving your home to rebuild a life in a new country.

  I know communities up and down our country will welcome new arrivals with open arms and support them to build a new life in the UK.


Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said:


  This is another important step in our support for BNOs to help them integrate and contribute to UK society.

  It reflects our commitment to the people of Hong Kong – and those who have now chosen to start a new life here.


Dr Krish Kandiah, Founder of UKHK.org said:


  The arrival of Hong Kongers will enrich the UK immensely and help thousands  of people live in freedom.

  All of us – neighbours, colleagues, fellow students, businesses – have important roles to play in making Hong Kongers feel welcome and to help their integration into British society. But government support is critical. That’s the clear lesson from past migrations. So it is great to see the government follow through on its commitment to help Hong Kongers successfully settle in the UK with an early package of assistance.


Today’s package also includes:

12 ‘virtual’ welcome hubs for new arrivals with funding for projects like local helplines, community led activities such as buddying up with other families, and English language support if needed, ensuring that people feel at home in their new community.
  A £986,000 national Voluntary, Community and Social Enterprise (VCSE) grant scheme will fund national projects that support BN(O) status holders in areas such as employment, mental health and wellbeing to help build community cohesion.
  As a part of the VCSE fund, MHCLG will develop dedicated Hong Kong educational resources for schools so that they can teach young people about our historic connection and commitment to Hong Kong and its people and, celebrate the contribution of the Hong Kong-British and Chinese-British Diaspora to the UK.
  Dedicated advice for BN(O)s and a comprehensive welcome pack to help BN(O) families navigate the move. This includes information on how to access public services, registering to vote and opening a bank account, pointing to local amenities like libraries and leisure centres and promoting the UK’s rich cultural, arts and music events, all translated into Cantonese.
To help drive integration work across government, the Communities Secretary has established an Inter-Ministerial Group that will consider issues such as access to public services, opportunities and safety for new arrivals across all four nations.

The UK’s offer of bespoke immigration route BN(O) status holders follows the Chinese government’s imposition of the National Security Law in Hong Kong last year.

Today’s package shows the UK will not look the other way on Hong Kong, and that this government will deliver on its historic responsibilities to the people of Hong Kong.

Sobriety tags detecting whether offenders have broken drinking bans will be rolled out across England as part of a crackdown on alcohol-fuelled crime
  Successful launch in Wales showed that offenders stayed sober for more than 95% of days monitored
  Alcohol is one of the driving influences of domestic violence and unprovoked attacks on strangers


Offenders who commit alcohol-driven crimes could be ordered to wear a tag which takes a sample of their sweat every 30 minutes and alerts the probation service if alcohol is detected. They face further court sentences or fines if caught breaching a ban.

More than 100 offenders have been tagged since the scheme launched in Wales in October and it has proven effective, with offenders staying sober on over 95% of days monitored. Offenders have credited the scheme with helping them improve their lifestyle and staff say the tags have helped the offenders stay away from crime.

Alcohol plays a part in 39% of violent crime, with the social and economic cost of drink-related harm around £21.5 billion per year and is seen as one of the drivers of domestic violence and unprovoked attacks. That is why the sobriety tags will be backed up by targeted professional support, signposting offenders to the help they need and helping to prevent future victims.

Minister for Crime and Policing, Kit Malthouse MP said:


  These tags have already brought enormous benefit to Wales since they were introduced in October, with one offender I met saying it not only changed his ways but also saved his life.



  This smart and powerful new tool is helping the fight against alcohol-fuelled violence which ruins too many lives and families and creates mayhem in our town centres.


The tags have helped probation officers in Wales steer offenders away from bad habits and get them the support they need to turn their backs on crime.

Probation officer Laura Harrison said:


  Sobriety tags have had an enormously positive effect on the people I’ve supervised in Wales, improving their mental health, keeping them off drink and out of trouble with the police.



  One man with a history of drink-related violence was given a tag for 90 days and has been sober ever since and says the scheme helped him turn his life around.


The tags can distinguish the difference between drinks and other types of alcohol – such as hand sanitiser or perfume. They work 24/7 and can also tell if someone tries to block contact between the tag and their skin.

It is the latest boost to the Government’s plans to make more effective use of tagging to help reduce crime following the launch of GPS tags being used to crack down on burglars and thieves earlier this month.

The Government is addressing the root causes of crime, tackling factors such as addiction, homelessness and mental health, and recently announced an extra £148m package to target drugs-related crime with the biggest boost in drug treatment spending in 15 years.

Supervision of offenders in the community is also being improved with greater powers for probation officers, novel uses of GPS tags and longer and more flexible curfews. For example, by having lesser restrictions Monday to Friday to keep offenders in work, but stricter curfews of up to 20 hours a day on weekends.

"166",2021-03-26,"The newly named Supporting Families programme to support some of the most vulnerable families in society.","
    
          

Successful programme to support vulnerable families launches its next phase, backed by £165 million in funding for 2021 to 2022.
  Over 400,000 vulnerable families supported to build brighter futures since 2015.
  Number of children going into care reduced through the programme, and the number of adults going to prison.
  New additional £7.9 million fund launched to improve how councils use data to support families, including by providing key workers with the information that they need.


The next phase of the government’s flagship programme to support some of the most vulnerable families in society has been launched by Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick today (26 March 2021), backed by £165 million funding.

The newly named ‘Supporting Families’ programme, previously known as the ‘Troubled Families’ programme, includes work to support people to leave abusive relationships, get the right joined-up support for those with mental health issues and help people to find work – all part of the government’s comprehensive programme of work to support and unite communities.

Through the programme, which began in 2012 – families are assigned a dedicated keyworker, who works with every member of the family and brings local services together to resolve issues at an early stage, before they develop into more significant problems.

Since 2015, over 400,000 vulnerable families have received support to help them turn their lives around and build brighter futures, and over 870,000 families have benefited from the programme’s ‘whole family’ approach to tackling problems.

The programme has delivered significant results while reducing costs of services for the taxpayer – with the proportion of children supported by the programme going into care reduced by a third and the proportion of adults going to prison reduced by a quarter.

Housing Secretary, Rt Hon. Robert Jenrick MP said:


  Working hand in hand with local councils and other partners we have helped over 400,000 vulnerable families.

  For the next phase, Supporting Families will continue this important work backed by £165 million funding to help families with multiple complex problems to overcome difficulties as early as possible. It is a critical part of our moral mission to tackle intergenerational unemployment, crime, domestic abuse and family breakdown.

  As we come out of the COVID-19 pandemic it is more important than ever we support families. The last year has shown what can be achieved if different agencies act as one and wrap their arms around the most vulnerable. That is the objective of Supporting Families, the renewed programme to turn around lives and help families to achieve their potential.


Eddie Hughes MP, Minister for Housing and Rough Sleeping said:


  The government is supporting the most vulnerable in our communities and the Supporting Families programme will help us to make lasting change to many more lives”.

  By working with every member of a family and bringing local services together, Supporting Families keyworkers get to the heart of the multiple and connected difficulties many families face and tackle them early – overcoming obstacles before they develop into something more serious and reducing the cost of services to the taxpayer.


During the pandemic, services funded by the programme played a vital role in helping families, providing access to food and equipment for children home learning. To continue to build relationships and ensure families were supported during lockdown, local areas introduced virtual meetups and garden or doorstep visits, within the social distancing guidelines and restrictions.

Building stronger data is key focus of the next phase of the programme, and the government today announced the launch of a new Data Accelerator Fund, backed by £7.9 million in additional funding, to improve how councils use data to support vulnerable families.

This includes identifying families that need support and helping frontline workers get the information they need. Councils will be able to bid for this funding, split over two years, to set up new data projects.

The government has today also published research on a £9.5 million Supporting Families Against Youth Violence fund, which supported 21 areas to run projects combatting knife crime between 2018 and 2020. The research showed that a whole family approaches were seen as effective in preventing youth crime.

The programme, previously named the ‘Troubled Families programme,’ will now be known as ‘Supporting Families’, to better reflect the role that keyworkers play.

Using its statutory market study powers, the CMA aims to obtain information to help build a better understanding of the children’s social care sector. Depending on what it finds, it can issue guidance to businesses and the public, make recommendations to the industry or to government or, if appropriate, launch a full investigation into the market.

Andrea Coscelli, Chief Executive of the CMA, said:


  Children in care are among the most vulnerable in our society and they need a system that does not let them down.



  We are concerned that some children are not getting access to the right placements due to a lack of availability in the system, and that rising prices are putting further pressure on stretched local authority budgets.



  The CMA is in a unique position to use its powers to look into this. But children’s care is not a market like any other - our clear and overriding priority will be about identifying ways children can get better care. This will include examining the concerns raised about the role of private sector providers, which has grown in the last few years, as well as the role of public and third sector providers.


In England, Scotland and Wales, around 99,000 children live under the care of their local authority. The majority of children in care, approximately 65,000, live in foster care. Around 16,000 children live in residential care, including children’s homes and independent or semi-independent living accommodation, with the remaining 18,000 in a range of other types of placement, including with their parents or placed for adoption.

Each local authority is responsible for contracting foster care and purchasing the required children’s homes places. Children are placed with foster carers, either directly by the local authority or by independent fostering agencies, which can be run for-profit in England and Wales but not in Scotland. Children’s homes are provided either directly by local authorities, by the private sector or by charities, with 70% of children in England and 78% of children in Wales placed in private sector homes.

The launch of the study comes after concerns have been raised by other organisations about private sector provision of children’s social care making high profit margins. A recent Local Government Association report found that some independent providers of children’s residential and fostering placements are achieving profits of more than 20% on their income. The study will examine whether high levels of profit have been made at the expense of investment in recruiting and retaining staff, and providing quality services.

The CMA will look at how well the current system of provision is working across England, Scotland and Wales and explore how it could be made to work better. In particular, it will look into:


    the supply of placements, including whether the current balance of local authority, private sector and third sector provision is working well for children and local authorities
  
  
    prices charged by providers and variation between prices paid for similar types of placement, with increasing prices potentially putting pressure on local authority budgets
  
  
    the way commissioning of places is carried out, and whether local authorities could be more effective in securing appropriate placements for children
  
  
    the environment for investing in the system to ensure sufficient appropriate places are available for all children who need them in the future, and whether any measures should be taken to improve this
  
In recent years, the CMA has carried out similar studies into funerals and care homes for older people, among others.

Comments on the issues raised can be submitted in the Invitation to Comment by 14 April 2021. All updates on the CMA’s work in this area can be found on the Children’s social care study page.

Notes for editors


    Market studies, like this one, may lead to a range of outcomes, including: (a) clean bill of health (b) actions which improve the quality and accessibility of information to consumers (c) taking consumer or competition law enforcement action (d) making recommendations to the government to change regulations or public policy (e) encouraging businesses in the market to self-regulate (f) making a reference for a more in-depth (phase 2) market investigation, or (g) accepting formal undertakings in lieu of a reference
  
  
    Costs charged to local councils for independent provision of children’s homes has increased by 40% from £2841 per week on average in 2013 to £3970 per week on average in 2019, according to data from the National Centre for Excellence in Residential Childcare.
  
  
    Recent reports by the NAO, HCLG Select Committee and Children’s Commissioner have been critical of public policy on children’s social care.
  
  
    The largest proportion of children’s homes places in England and Wales are provided by the for-profit sector – around 70% in England and 78% in Wales in February 2020. In England, there has been a 19% increase in for-profit provision since 2016 (based on 2019 data). In England and Wales, independent fostering agencies (IFAs) provide 18% of placements, but in Scotland it is prohibited to run a fostering agency on a for-profit basis.
  
  
    A report published in January 2021 by the Local Government Association and Revolution Consulting, Profit making and Risk in Independent Children’s Social Care Placement Providers, found that some large private providers were achieving profits of 20.6% on their income.
  
  
    The children’s social care system is the subject of significant policy attention across the UK, including through the independent review of children’s social care in England, the implementation of the Promise review recommendations in Scotland and the Improving Outcomes for Children programme in Wales. The CMA’s study will take into account the policy context of each nation.

Specialist support for 18-25 year olds under probation supervision
  First hub to be based in Newham, London
  Range of specialist services, including drug and mental health support, will based under one roof


The hub, the first of its kind, will be based at Newham Probation Office and has been developed by the Ministry of Justice and the Mayor for London’s Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC).

Young adults have a particularly high risk of reoffending and are more likely to carry out drug, robbery and possession of weapons offences, and be caught up in gang crime.

Mental health and substance misuse experts will work alongside National Probation Service staff, as part of an innovative new approach ensuring vulnerable young adults, many of whom had troubled upbringings and poor education, receive the enhanced support they need to avoid a life of crime.

Offenders released without a home or a job are significantly more likely to reoffend, so accommodation, training and employment services will also operate from the hub to help cut crime.

This support is already available but bringing this range of services under one roof and tackling these complex issues together at an early stage can prevent thousands of people becoming victims each year and save some of the £18 billion annual cost of repeat crimes.

Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary, Robert Buckland, MP, said:


  This ground-breaking new model will help offenders get their lives back on the straight-and-narrow before it’s too late and they become career criminals.



  It will mean less reoffending and fewer people becoming victims of crime while also giving these young adults all the tools they need to make the most of their lives.


London’s Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime, Sophie Linden, said:


  It’s vital we do everything we can to prevent reoffending and give young people who have been through the criminal justice system the support they need to turn their lives around.



  We know the pandemic has meant fewer jobs and opportunities for our young people and that is why this new hub in Newham is so important. It will give us the platform to make vital interventions and deliver specialist support to vulnerable young people, helping them turn away from crime and rebuild their lives through access to housing, education and job opportunities.


The pilot will launch in July and run until March 2023 for 18-25 year olds who are assessed as having low levels of maturity and 17 year olds transitioning from the Youth Offending Service to adult probation. It will then be externally evaluated and, if a success at reducing reoffending and improving outcomes for this cohort, rolled out across the country.

All staff will receive specific training in the brain development of young people. Young adults have distinct needs, which are different to both older adults and children and treating them as a specific group will ensure the root causes of their offending are spotted and addressed earlier on in their development.

This £3 million of Government funding follows a £148 million investment to protect people from the scourge of illegal drugs and a £70 million package to support offenders into temporary accommodation upon release.

Taken together, this £220 million of funding highlights the Government’s commitment to tackling crime.

the Clink Kitchens training programme to expand to up to 70 prisons
  training reduces reoffending rates by 32% and will transform the lives and prospects of thousands of offenders
  part of government’s commitment to build back safer by cutting reoffending, which costs the taxpayer £18 billion a year


Over the next 3 years, Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) and The Clink charity have agreed to extend their training programme, currently already operating in HMPs High Down, Cardiff, Brixton and Styal, to offenders working in an additional 70 prison kitchens.

Following successful pilots, training will continue at HMPs Bristol and Styal and from the end of April they will be first joined by Eastwood Park, Send and Downview with a steady further rollout creating opportunities to help as many as two thousand offenders into employment and away from crime for good.

Boosting access to work and safe accommodation for prison leavers will also help build back safer communities by cutting crime and reducing reoffending, which costs the taxpayer £18 billion each year.

Prisons Minister Lucy Frazer MP, said:


  This expansion of the catering programme is testament to the thousands of training and job opportunities it has provided for offenders over the years.

  Cutting reoffending and its vast cost to society is a priority for this government. Training within prison leads to employment on release, which we know has such a positive impact on ex-offenders, their families and communities, and ultimately reduces crime.


The Clink’s training scheme is proven to significantly cut rates of reoffending, with offenders 32% less likely to go on to commit further crimes compared to those who did not receive training.  This success means for every £1 invested, The Clink Charity is likely to generate at least £4.80 back to the prison service, government and society in reduced reoffending rates.

The expansion to more prisons marks a new era for the partnership with HMPPS, which over a decade has helped more than 2,500 ex-offenders find employment.

The training sees serving prisoners work in professionally run kitchens for up to 35 hours a week, preparing and cooking up to 80,000 daily meals for fellow prisoners. Trainees will work towards gaining City and Guilds National Vocational Qualifications Levels 1, 2 and 3, while improving their confidence, teamworking and communication skills.

The scheme will be funded entirely by The Clink through generous donations from many organisations and supporters.

Finlay T K Scott, Chairman of The Clink Charity said:


  Reducing crime and improving all of our lives is at the heart of what The Clink does. This latest initiative in partnership with HMPPS underlines the tremendous impact The Clink program has had over the last ten years.

  We will build upon the success of our innovative integrated program and roll it out across the prison estate. This platform will dramatically increase the number of students we are able to rehabilitate with the subsequent impact upon reoffending figures.


The partnership with The Clink Charity is one of many government schemes aimed at supporting offenders into employment with the ultimate aim of cutting crime. Other initiatives include work placements for dozens of offenders as the construction of HMP Five Wells gets underway, as well as the new prison at Glen Parva.

Notes to editors

Justice Data Lab figures show the rate of reoffending for prisoners who participated in the scheme was 15%, compared to 22% for those who did not. This is a difference of 32%.
  Over the next 3 years New Futures Network, the specialist part of HMPPS which works to create employment opportunities for serving prisoners and prison leavers, will help The Clink deliver their sector-led training program. The Clink Charity is unique as it not only delivers training inside the prison but carries on with full support and mentoring post-release to help them reintegrate back into society, gain full-time employment and ultimately reduce reoffending.

"170",2021-02-10,"Housing Secretary unveils a 5-point  plan which will provide reassurance to homeowners and confidence to the housing market.","
    
          

Housing Secretary announces the government will pay for the removal of unsafe cladding for all leaseholders in high-rise buildings, providing reassurance and protecting them from costs
  New levy and tax on developers to ensure industry contributes
  Measures will boost the housing market and free up homeowners to once again buy and sell their properties


Hundreds of thousands of leaseholders will be protected from the cost of replacing unsafe cladding on their homes, as Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick unveiled a five-point plan which will provide reassurance to homeowners and bring confidence to the housing market.

With an unprecedented £5 billion investment in building safety, including £3.5 billion announced today (10 February 2021), the Housing Secretary confirmed to the House of Commons that the government will fully fund the cost of replacing unsafe cladding for all leaseholders in residential buildings 18 metres (6 storeys) and over in England.

This will ensure funding is targeted at the highest risk buildings in line with longstanding independent expert advice and evidence, with Home Office analysis of fire and rescue service statistics showing buildings between 18 and 30 metres are four times as likely to suffer a fire with fatalities or serious casualties than apartment buildings in general.

Lower-rise buildings, with a lower risk to safety, will gain new protection from the costs of cladding removal with a generous new scheme offered to buildings between 11 and 18 metres. This will pay for cladding removal – where it is needed – through a long-term, low interest, government-backed financing arrangement.

Under the scheme, no leaseholder will ever pay more than £50 a month towards the removal of unsafe cladding. This will provide reassurance and security to leaseholders, and mortgage providers can be confident that where cladding removal is needed, properties will be worth lending against.

The government is working with industry to reduce the need for EWS1 forms, preventing leaseholders from facing delays and allowing hundreds of thousands of homes to be sold, bought, or re-mortgaged once again.

The Housing Secretary today announced plans to introduce a, ‘Gateway 2’ developer levy. The proposed levy will be targeted and apply when developers seek permission to develop certain high-rise buildings in England.

In addition, a new tax will be introduced for the UK residential property development sector. This will raise at least £2 billion over a decade to help pay for cladding remediation costs. The tax will ensure that the largest property developers make a fair contribution to the remediation programme, reflecting the benefit they will derive from restoring confidence to the UK housing market. The government will consult on the policy design in due course.

The government will protect future generations from similar mistakes by bringing forward legislation this year to tighten the regulation of building safety and to review the construction products regime to prevent malpractice arising again.

Today’s measures will mean people living in homes which they have been prevented from selling, or re-mortgaging, through no fault of their own, will now be able to move on with their lives.

Housing Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:


  This is a comprehensive plan to remove unsafe cladding, support leaseholders, restore confidence to this part of the housing market and ensure this situation never arises again.

  Our unprecedented intervention means the hundreds of thousands of leaseholders who live in higher-rise buildings will now pay nothing towards the cost of removing unsafe cladding.

  Remedying the failures of building safety cannot just be a responsibility for taxpayers. That is why we will also be introducing a levy and tax on developers to contribute to righting the wrongs of the past.

  These measures will provide certainty to residents and lenders, boosting the housing market, reinstating the value of properties and getting buying and selling homes back on track. We are working with lenders and surveyors to make this happen.

  Our landmark intervention will make homes safer and free those who did the right thing – saving for years to get on the property ladder – to enjoy the homes in which they have invested so much.


Barclays:


  Barclays welcomes this announcement as a positive step forward. These changes will bring greater certainty and clarity for homeowners, prospective buyers and surveyors.

  We expect that will make it far easier for buyers, sellers and lenders to value properties, aiding this part of the housing market to start moving again.

  Barclays remains open to support our customers and prospective buyers with any of their home ownership needs, including in this part of the market.


Joe Garner – CEO Nationwide Building Society said:


  Nationwide welcomes the £3.5 billion grant funding the government has announced to ensure the cladding on peoples’ home is safe and to protect the people who live in them. This is a decisive step forward which we hope brings some relief to people worried about the safety of their homes.

  Supporting people who find themselves living in this difficult position could not be more important. We look forward to working with government, lenders and other interested parties to understand the details and implement the initiative quickly.


The government is aware that securing appropriate professional indemnity insurance to cover the completion of EWS1 forms is a major barrier to qualified professionals undertaking EWS1 forms. The government is therefore committing today to work towards a targeted, state-backed indemnity scheme for qualified professionals unable to obtain professional indemnity insurance for the completion of EWS1 forms.

The government will work closely with industry to design an appropriate scheme. Further details on the scheme, including eligibility and the claims process, will be provided in the coming weeks.

The Grenfell tragedy laid bare failings in the building industry dating back 30 years. Today’s announcement is a further step by the government to bring about the biggest changes to building safety in a generation, ensuring people are safe and feel safe in their own homes.

The measures build on steps already taken to support leaseholders, including £1.6 billion of funding to remediate unsafe cladding, the £30 million Waking Watch fund to help end unfair and excessive costs and new legislation in the Building Safety Bill which will ensure homes are made and kept safer in future.

    Local Government Secretary confirms £51.3 billion package for councils
  
  
    £2.3 billion increase in core spending, includes access to extra £1 billion for social care
  
  
    An estimated £3 billion additional support for councils to deal with COVID-19 pressures
  


Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick has confirmed today (10 February 2021) that councils across England will have access to £51.3 billion next year.

This represents a £2.3 billion increase on this year – including access to an extra £1 billion for social care to help support vulnerable adults and children.

This funding package gives councils the resources they need to continue to deliver services and support their communities during the pandemic while protecting council taxpayers from excessive increases.

It will also enable councils to play a crucial role in our nation’s recovery in helping schools and local businesses to reopen safely and support the most vulnerable.

Final allocations for the £670 million fund to enable councils to continue reducing council tax bills for those least able to pay, have also been confirmed today, helping households impacted financially by the pandemic. This is over and above the usual council tax support available for councils each year.

In addition, Mr Jenrick has extended the scheme that compensates councils for income lost during the pandemic from services including car parks, leisure facilities and museums, until June 2021.

This follows £1.55 billion of unringfenced funding which was announced in November to help councils continue to support their communities during the pandemic.

This means a further £3 billion of additional support for councils to deal with the pandemic in 2021-22 has been confirmed, taking the total overall amount of pandemic support to over £11 billion.

Local Government Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:


  Councils have played a key role during the pandemic by delivering vital services and supporting the most vulnerable backed with over £8 billion of emergency support from government to date.

  Today I am pleased to confirm a £51 billion funding package for next year that increases funding for social care and other vital services by £2.3 billion. We are also giving councils an additional £3 billion boost to the level of COVID support available.

  This is a fair and generous settlement that gives councils the resources they to continue to deliver important services and support their communities while protecting council tax payers from excessive increases.


In addition to the funding confirmed for councils, we have announced the following:

Rewards for welcoming new homes

The government has confirmed allocations for English local authorities totalling £622 million to continue the New Homes Bonus scheme in 2021-22; rewarding councils for the number of additional new homes built in their area, incentivising housing growth and creating homes for their residents.

We have also published a consultation alongside the Local Government Finance Settlement on reforming the scheme from 2022-23, to ensure it is focussed where homes are needed most.

Giving residents a voice on council tax rises

Residents will have the power to veto excessive council tax rises, with a referendum being required if councils propose raising the tax by 2% or more, with extra flexibility for some authority types. Before setting rates, councils should take into account the financial circumstances of their residents.

Councils with responsibility for adult social care will be able to set a further 3% increase, ring-fenced exclusively for adult social care. Anything above this level will need to be voted on by local people. This strikes the right balance between addressing pressure on services and giving residents the final say on excessive increases.

In order to enable councils to continue supporting those least able to pay their council tax, including households financially hard-hit by the pandemic, there will be £670 million of new grant funding available outside of the core settlement for local council tax support.

Support for rural areas

The government is committed to ensuring the unique needs of rural areas are met, and so will boost the Rural Services Delivery Grant by £4 million to £85 million next year, making it the highest rural grant paid to date.

In addition, we have also announced:

Additional support to help a small number of councils

Today we are confirming details of additional support to a small number of councils who are unable to balance their budgets for 2020-21 or 2021-22. This support is being provided on an exceptional basis and the decision to grant these requests follows a robust and challenging process to confirm that councils have taken all reasonable steps to manage pressures locally.

These councils will now need to undertake an independent assurance review focused on the council’s current financial position, sustainability and their ability to meet any of the identified budget gaps for 2021-22 without additional recourse to government.

Extension of the flexibility to use capital receipts to fund transformation projects

We are also announcing a 3-year extension from 2022-23 onwards of the existing flexibility for councils to use capital receipts to fund transformation projects that produce long-term savings or reduce the costs of service delivery. We will provide further details on the extension in due course.

Confirmation of £160.6 million for the Former Independent Living Fund Recipient Grant

This grant is paid to councils to ensure they can continue funding pre-existing Independent Living Fund arrangements, enabling those with disabilities to live within the community and not residential care.

£50,000 for the Isle of Wight

This fund will be used to review the challenges face by the council, residents and businesses on the island who are separated from the mainland. This could include access to vital services, supplies and employment.

New standard tenancy agreement makes it easier for tenants with pets to find rented accommodation
  Landlords using the revised Model Tenancy Agreement encouraged to no longer issue a blanket ban on pets
  Just 7% of private landlords currently advertise pet friendly properties


Responsible tenants with well-behaved pets will be able to secure leases more easily through the new Model Tenancy Agreement announced by the government today (28 January 2021).

Under the new Model Tenancy Agreement, announced by Housing Minister Rt Hon Christopher Pincher MP, landlords will no longer be able to issue blanket bans on pets by default.

Instead, consent for pets will be the default position, and landlords will have to object in writing within 28 days of a written pet request from a tenant and provide a good reason.

Currently, just 7% of private landlords advertise pet friendly properties, meaning many people struggle to find suitable homes. In some cases, this has meant people have had to give up their pets all together.

The Model Tenancy Agreement is the government’s recommended contract for landlords. With figures showing that more than half of adults in the United Kingdom own a pet and many more welcoming pets into their lives during the pandemic, these changes mean more landlords will cater for responsible pet owners.

Under the new agreement, rejections should only be made where there is good reason, such as in smaller properties or flats where owning a pet could be impractical.  To ensure landlords are protected, tenants will continue to have a legal duty to repair or cover the cost of any damage to the property.

Housing Minister Rt Hon Christopher Pincher MP said:


  We are a nation of animal lovers and over the last year more people than ever before have welcome pets into their lives and homes.

  But it can’t be right that only a tiny fraction of landlords advertise pet friendly properties and in some cases people have had to give up their beloved pets in order to find somewhere to live.

  For those who choose to use the revised Model Tenancy Agreement, we are bringing an end to the unfair default blanket ban on pets introduced by some landlords. This strikes the right balance between helping more people find a home that’s right for them and their pet while ensuring landlords’ properties are safeguarded against inappropriate or badly behaved pets.

"173",2021-01-23,"38 organisations will receive almost £2 million in government funding so their vital work steering women away from crime can continue.","
    
          

around £2 million to support community services that work with vulnerable women
  cross-government agreement to reduce the number of women in the Criminal Justice System
  extra investment in prison places to improve conditions for women in custody


The funding comes as the government reiterates its commitment to reduce the number of women in custody and improve conditions for those that are serving time.

Over £5 million has already been invested in services supporting women in the criminal justice system since 2018. This latest funding will help cover running costs such as wages, rent and bills at a time when many charities have additional demand for their services due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The Ministry of Justice has pledged to work alongside other government departments and public services such as the National Health Service and Public Health England to more effectively support vulnerable women in addressing the issues which can lead them to commit crimes, while up to 500 new prison places will be built in existing women’s prisons to improve conditions.

Lucy Frazer QC MP, Minister for Prisons and Probation said:


  This funding boost will allow frontline services to continue the incredible work they do with some of the most vulnerable women in our society to prevent them being drawn into crime.

  Many female offenders suffer complex issues and have experienced very traumatic lives - and it’s only by addressing this that we will break the costly cycle of reoffending.


The funding announced today (23 January 2021) will support organisations such as Shropshire based Willowdene, which was awarded nearly £60,000 and uses a mixture of therapy that addresses traumatic life experiences and work placements to rehabilitate women dealing with issues such as substance misuse and exploitation. A grant of £60,000 will allow Cheshire Without Abuse to continue its vital work with domestic abuse victims, as cases continue to rise during lockdown. These services play a crucial part in preventing women being drawn into crime and help reduce rates of reoffending for those that are. 

Dr Matthew Home, CEO of Willowdene Rehabilitation Ltd said:


  Referrals to our service have increased during lockdown, particularly for women leaving custody and aiming to complete a period of rehabilitation prior to going home. This funding will allow us to maximise the number of women we can help at any one time, as our core costs are covered through the grant.


While women who commit the most serious crimes will always be sent to prison, custody should always be a last resort. The number of women in custody has fallen by 10% since 2010 and government investment in community services should see this trend continue in the long-term. However, the recruitment of an extra 20,000 police officers is expected to cause a temporary increase in in the female prison population.

Up to 500 new places will be built in existing prisons to increase availability of single cells and improve conditions. These will include in-cell showers and will allow more women to be held in open conditions, providing greater opportunities for employment and education while completing their sentence. Some of the new places will also allow women to have overnight visits with their children to prepare for life back home. If, as expected, the female prison population falls longer-term, these modern facilities will allow the Prison Service to close old accommodation.

Around half of women in prison have a mental health issue and a similar proportion have a history of drug use. Dealing with these underlying issues can help reduce the chance of women entering the criminal justice system in the first place and reduce reoffending rates when they do.

This requires a whole host of different agencies, local and national, to work together to help each individual offender, whether that be, getting into addiction treatment, finding a stable home or escaping an abusive partner. This ‘whole-system approach’ gives women a better chance of turning their lives around and has been endorsed again by government today in the National Concordat on Female Offenders.  

The drive to cut offending by women also stands to benefit from the largest increase in drug treatment funding in fifteen years announced earlier this week. An extra £80 million is being invested in services across England to increase the number of treatment places for prison leavers and those diverted into tough and effective community sentences.

"174",2021-01-22,"A ground-breaking Local Partnership Agreement has been signed by the Department for Work and Pensions and Her Majesty’s Prison & Probation Service (HMPPS).","
    
          The agreement aims to get the best possible outcome for offenders on leaving custody.

The agreement, the first of its kind, is a contract between the department and prisons, setting out a steadfast commitment to working together and outlining shared objectives.

It is hoped this joined-up approach will effectively support offenders in preparation for release, and ultimately reduce reoffending which costs the taxpayer £18 billion each year.

Local Partnership Agreements form part of National Partnership Agreements, which aim to support businesses by increasing opportunities and moving unemployed people into sustainable jobs.

Minister for Welfare Delivery, Will Quince, said:


  We are proud to be joining forces with HMPPS through this unique partnership and together we remain committed to ensuring prison leavers stay out of jail for good.



  Our dedicated teams of Prison Work Coaches are passionate about finding work for prison leavers. Preparing them for employment and life back in the community before release we know can make a life-changing difference and help free them from crime.


Minister for Prisons, Lucy Frazer, added:


  Helping prisoners find work is a crucial part of turning their lives around and cutting crime.



  This new partnership will mean prisoners are able to prepare for employment while they’re getting ready for release – benefitting them, the economy and society as a whole.


Under the agreement, each partner sets out their defined roles and statutory responsibilities, but each must work together to ensure the most effective join-up between services to provide support to those in custody, and on leaving.

Each local agreement is tailored to the individual prison. Quarterly meetings will be held between both partners and the agreement regularly reviewed.

This collaborative approach between the DWP and HMPPS to support prisoners brings together many services from providing work experience and education in prison and beyond, through to support, training and employment opportunities for ex-offenders.

And now, thanks to the national rollout of a phone line, prison leavers will also be supported to claim Universal Credit online, and can apply for an advance meaning they can access money on the day of release.

East Anglia District Manager Julia Nix said:


  Everybody deserves a second chance. Many prison leavers want to make a change on release and return to a life of work, and that has to be beneficial for the economy.



  Together with support from HMPPS we encourage, support and prepare prisoners for employment because we know that a job can help turn their lives around, lift them from poverty, and that motivates us every day.

"175",2021-01-18,"Secure video calls rolled out in all prisons in just over 6 months to maintain vital family contact.","
    
          

over 90,000 calls made so far, connecting families in the UK and overseas
  technology helped teenager communicate again with his deaf mother and allowed a prisoner to meet his baby for the first time


Secure video calls are now running in all public and private prisons and young offender institutions (YOIs) across England and Wales, helping to maintain vital family ties and boost rehabilitation during the Coronavirus pandemic.

Offenders with strong family ties are less likely to reoffend, which costs the taxpayer around £18 billion per year, while 97% of prisoners say that video calls have a positive impact on their mental health.

With the final installation of video call technology taking place last month, in just over 6 months, over 90,000 video calls have been made totalling almost 45,000 hours and connecting families in more than 100 countries, while social visits were suspended to help reduce the spread of the virus, save lives and protect the NHS.

The secure video calls are allowing prisoners to see their toddlers take their first steps, say goodbye to a terminally-ill loved one and helping those struggling with their mental health.

Prisons Minister Lucy Frazer QC MP said:


  Video calls have been a huge success in our response to COVID-19 in the prison estate, with staff and offenders overwhelmingly positive about the impact of the technology.

  Prisoners have seen drastic changes to their daily routines to save lives and to protect local health services. Part of that has been the loss of social visits – something we know plays a huge role in prisoners’ wellbeing and rehabilitation and these calls are allowing them to keep this vital family contact.


The video calls take place on secure laptops in a designated area in each prison. Safeguards are in place to prevent misuse with all participants checked in advance, calls are monitored by prison staff and restrictions have been built into the software to ensure safe use.

Graham Barrett, Governor at HMP Wandsworth said:


  Video calls have been an incredibly positive step forward in what has been a very difficult time. It has revolutionised the way that people can communicate with loved ones and having such a user- friendly service has ensured that the men in our care can keep in touch with family and friends all over the world.


A Prisoner at HMP Thorn Cross said:


  It has been a complete game-changer for me. I can’t imagine not seeing my children for the past nine months, so the peace of mind of knowing that they are ok, and for them to see me and know that I am ok has really helped all of us.

  My family do not live locally, so I would like to continue to use video calling to speak to them, even after visits and ROTL are running again.


The new technology builds on the 2017 Lord Farmer review which found that close bonds between prisoners and family members can significantly reduce their risk of reoffending.

Plans are being implemented for the long-term. In the meantime, video calls remain in place for prisoners and their loved-ones while social visits are restricted.

Notes to editors

Video calls are a complementary resource to help maintain family contact not a replacement for social visits and where face-to-face visits can safely be delivered and remain the preference, no prisoner will be asked to substitute that for a video call.
  Time-limited calls are made either by prisoners making a call request to their designated contact or by families who can request a time slot through a mobile app or directly with the establishment.
  In March the government introduced temporary restrictions in prisons to prevent the virus taking hold – a decision that has saved the lives of staff, prisoners and children in custody, and protected the NHS.
  These measures, backed by Public Health England, included:
    Creating distinct areas where vulnerable prisoners can shield, the symptomatic can isolate, and new arrivals can quarantine
      Creating an additional 1,200 temporary cells so people are better able to social distance and we can limit the spread of infection
      Making important adjustments to prison life – including placing prisoners in social ‘bubbles’ so they could safely spend more time out of their cells for vital education, work, and exercise
    
  We are further bolstering our defences to reduce the risk of transmission by:
    Temporarily stopping social visits for adult prisoners in line with the new national restrictions. However, visits for compassionate reasons, visits to children in custody and official or legal visits will continue.
      Introducing routine testing of frontline staff and prisoners who arrive from court or transfer from other jails to catch infections earlier.
      Making more Personal Protective Equipment available to staff who come into close contact with offenders, so they can protect themselves and the offenders in their care.

Extra support to house rough sleepers across all councils in England
  Ban on bailiff enforced evictions extended
  Confirmation of court support for landlords and renters and launch of mediation pilot


Extra support to help protect rough sleepers and renters from the effects of COVID-19 has been announced by the Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick today (8 January 2021).

Backed by an additional £10 million in funding, all councils in England are being asked to redouble their efforts to help accommodate all those currently sleeping rough and ensure they are swiftly registered with a GP, where they are not already.

This will ensure they can be protected from the virus and contacted to receive vaccinations in line with the priority groups outlined by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.

Councils will also be asked to reach out again to those who have previously refused help, given rising infection rates and the colder winter months.

Renters will continue to be supported during the new national restrictions, with an extension to the ban on bailiff evictions for all but the most egregious cases for at least 6 weeks – until at least 21 February – with measures kept under review.

Communities Secretary, Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:


  At the start of this pandemic we made sure that the most vulnerable in society were protected. This winter, we are continuing in this vein and redoubling our efforts to help those most in need.

  Our ongoing Everyone In initiative is widely regarded as one of the most successful of its kind in the world, ensuring 33,000 people are safe in accommodation. We are now going further and focusing on GP registration of rough sleepers.

  We are also extending the ban on bailiff evictions – helping to protect the most vulnerable renters.


Court rules and procedures introduced in September to support both tenants and landlords will remain in place and regularly reviewed. The courts will continue to prioritise cases, such as those involving anti-social behaviour, illegal occupation and perpetrators of domestic abuse in the social sector.

Landlords continue to be required to give 6-month notice periods to tenants until at least 31 March except in the most serious circumstances.

Councils will work closely with local health partners to ensure those sleeping rough are able to access the COVID-19 vaccine in line with the priority groups outlined by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.

This will be done through a GP, or by other means if mainstream provision is unsuitable, ensuring that the wider health needs of rough sleepers are addressed and assessed for clinical vulnerability to COVID, supporting them now and for the future.

Jon Sparkes, Chief Executive of Crisis, said:


  These renewed efforts to protect people who are homeless in the pandemic will save lives.

  It was truly a landmark moment when, back in March, everyone on the streets was offered somewhere safe to stay. It’s as important, if not more so, that today we see government leadership to protect all those sleeping rough. The highly infectious new strain of coronavirus alongside the cold weather makes this the most dangerous moment of the pandemic for those without a home.

  What is very welcome here is the two-pronged approach – a continued commitment to getting everyone into safe accommodation but also now making sure people are registered with a GP so they can quickly access the vaccines. We know through our services that people facing homelessness often are not registered with a doctor’s surgery. Addressing this issue will be a lifesaving intervention and a step towards ensuring people who are homeless are protected in the longer-term.


Steve Douglas CBE, Chief Executive of St Mungo’s, said:


  We and other homelessness charities called on government to provide an urgent and decisive response to support those sleeping rough who now face the double threat of severely cold weather and a continued health emergency.

  We welcome this response and will work with our local authority and health partners to provide both the immediate accommodation and the health care advice that is needed to protect lives.


A new mediation pilot will further support landlords and renters who face court procedures and potential eviction from next month (February). It will offer mediation as part of the possession process to try and help landlords and tenants to reach a mutual agreement and keep people in their homes.

Helping to resolve disputes through mediation will enable courts to prioritise urgent cases, supporting landlords and tenants to resolve issues quickly without the need for a formal hearing. The mediation pilot will work within the existing court arrangements in England and Wales.

The protections for renters are on top of the comprehensive package of support the government has put in place to help households, including support for businesses to pay staff salaries and strengthening the welfare safety-net by billions of pounds.

This has helped to protect renters from the economic fallout of the pandemic by supporting them meet their outgoings, including paying their rent.

The government has also provided unprecedented support for rough sleepers during the pandemic. This £10 million investment builds on more than £700 million government spending on homelessness and rough sleeping this year alone.

Through Everyone In, by November we had supported around 33,000 people with nearly 10,000 in emergency accommodation and over 23,000 already moved on into longer-term accommodation.

Further informatiom

Renters’ additional information

The package of support is reducing the number of evictions as applications to the courts for possession by private and social landlords were down 86% between July and September 2020, compared to the same quarter in 2019. No repossessions were recorded between April and end September 2020 compared to 14,847 in the same period last year.

The government has changed the law in England to ensure bailiffs do not enforce evictions for 6 weeks until 22 February, with no evictions expected to 8 March at the earliest. This will be kept under review.

The only exceptions to this are for the most egregious cases – anti-social behaviour, illegal occupation, death of a tenant where the property is unoccupied, fraud, perpetrators of domestic abuse in social housing and extreme rent arrears equivalent to 6 months’ rent.

Guidance to support landlords and tenants in the social and private rented sectors understand the possession action process and new rules within the court system in England and Wales is available.

For those renters who require additional support, there is an existing £180 million of government funding for Discretionary Housing Payments for councils to distribute to support renters with housing costs.

Rough sleepers’ additional information

A recent study published by the Lancet showed that because of this response 266 deaths were avoided during the first wave of the pandemic among England’s homeless population, as well as 21,092 infections, 1,164 hospital admissions and 338 admissions to Intensive Care Units.

The government has allocated £91.5 million to 274 councils in September to fund immediate support and interim accommodation for vulnerable people, as well as the £10 million Cold Weather Fund for councils to help to keep rough sleepers safe this winter.

This is alongside over £150 million to bring forward 3,300 long-term homes this year alone, alongside £112 million funding of the Rough Sleeping Initiative this year.

Councils have also received £4.6 billion in unringfenced grants to help them to manage the impacts of COVID-19, which we have been clear includes their work to support rough sleepers.

New £30million Waking Watch Relief Fund for fire alarms to reduce costs for leaseholders forced to have a waking watch
  £1 billion Building Safety Fund deadlines extended to ensure more eligible buildings can remove unsafe cladding
  Around 95% of buildings with dangerous ‘Grenfell type’ ACM cladding to have completed remediation or have workers on site by the end of the year


The government has today (17 December 2020) announced a £30 million fund to help end the scandal of excessive waking watch costs, as part of a further move to support thousands of residents in high-rise buildings.

The new Waking Watch Relief Fund will pay for the installation of fire alarm systems in high-rise buildings with cladding, removing or reducing the need for costly interim safety measures such as ‘waking watch’.

The National Fire Chiefs Council have been clear in recent guidance that building owners should move to install common fire alarm systems as quickly as possible to reduce or remove dependence on waking watches.

The steps today will help worried leaseholders who may have faced high costs for interim safety measures by providing financial support and delivering a better, long term fire safety system in their buildings.

Some buildings have already installed these systems due to the significant savings this offers, with leaseholders in those buildings, who on average were paying £137 per month for a waking watch, expected to collectively save over £3 million per month.

The same research shows the wide range in costs faced by leaseholders and evidence of disproportionate charges – the Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick is writing to Trading Standards asking them to use their powers to investigate.

The fund will open in January, but will also provide immediate, emergency support to Wicker Riverside Apartments in Sheffield to ensure that the 35 recently evacuated families should be able to return to their homes before Christmas.

A 6-month extension to the deadline for building owners to complete their applications to the £1 billion Building Safety Fund has also been announced - with a new deadline for submissions of 30 June 2021.

This means hundreds more buildings will be remediated and thousands of leasehold residents will be protected from costs. Progress is being made on current applications with many more expected to be agreed before Christmas.

Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said:


  I’ve heard first-hand from leaseholders the misery that rip-off waking watch costs have been bringing to residents of high-rise buildings with cladding.

  I’m announcing today a £30m Waking Watch Relief Fund to help relieve the financial pressure on those residents and to ensure they are safe. I’m confident that this will make a real difference to worried leaseholders up and down the country this Christmas.

  We have continued to prioritise the removal of unsafe ACM cladding throughout the pandemic and expect around 95% of remediation work will have been completed or be underway by the end of this year.


National Fire Chiefs Council Chair, Roy Wilsher said:


  We welcome this new Waking Watch Relief Fund, which will help to reduce the financial burden for some leaseholders having to fund the costs of waking watches.

  It has been our firm and long held expectation that building owners should move to install common fire alarms as quickly as possible and this funding is a positive step.


Building Safety Minister Lord Greenhalgh said:


  Our priority is making sure people are safer in their homes and we are working tirelessly to make this happen.

  The measures announced today build on our commitment, which will be enshrined in law through our Building Safety Bill, to improve the safety of buildings across the country.

  Building owners are responsible for making sure that their buildings, and the people who live in them, are safe. We continue to actively pursue them to encourage swift action and have supported this with £1.6 billion in government funding.


This builds on steps the government has already made to support leaseholders including securing an agreement that owners of flats in buildings without cladding do not need an EWS1 form to sell or re-mortgage their property - benefitting nearly 450,000 homeowners.

These measures are part of the government’s commitment to improve the safety of buildings across the country which will be enshrined in law through the Building Safety Bill in 2021.

The government is clear the building industry must contribute towards the costs of making these homes safe once more, to set right decades of unsafe practices.  Work continues at pace to develop further financial solutions to protect leaseholders with details to be announced in the new year.

£23 million investment for 43 areas this year, boosted by a further £52 million in 2021 to 2022
  Initial £10 million funding confirmed to provide extra accommodation for rough sleepers throughout winter


Rough sleepers across England will receive extra support to help them recover from drug and alcohol misuse, Minister for Rough Sleeping and Housing, Kelly Tolhurst MP announced today (14 December 2020).

Forty-three areas across England will receive support from a £23 million government fund designed for those with drug and alcohol support needs to get the help they need to rebuild their lives. The programme will be boosted by a further £52 million in 2021 to 2022.

Rough sleepers who are being provided with emergency accommodation during the pandemic as part of the government’s ‘Everyone In’ programme, and people who are currently rough sleeping, will be eligible for support.

In partnership with the Department of Health and Social Care, and managed by Public Health England, the funding will enable them to access drug and alcohol treatment, including detox and rehabilitation services.

This will be alongside wraparound support, such as access to mental health and substance dependence workers and peer mentors, who are key to working with vulnerable people in treatment services.

The minister has also confirmed an initial £10 million funding for 19 areas, plus the Greater London Authority, under the government’s £15 million ‘Protect Programme’. This is to provide accommodation for rough sleepers during the pandemic in areas that required extra support during the restrictions and throughout winter.

Taken together, government spending on rough sleeping and homelessness this year is over £700 million, with the ‘Everyone In’ campaign helping to protect thousands of lives during the pandemic by housing rough sleepers in safe accommodation.

Minister for Rough Sleeping and Housing, Kelly Tolhurst said:


  We know that one of the main issues facing those sleeping rough, or at risk of homelessness, is misuse of drugs or alcohol and what a crippling effect these substances have on people’s lives.

  While our ‘Everyone In’ campaign has helped to protect thousands of lives, we still need to work hard to break the cycle of rough sleeping for good.

  This funding will provide thousands of vulnerable people with the support they need to get on the road to recovery to rebuild their lives away from the streets for good.


Health Minister Jo Churchill said:


  The need to support the most vulnerable groups in society has never been more important or more apparent than this year.

  We are committed to supporting those who want to break the cycle of addiction.

  This funding will not only help those personally fighting addiction, but also benefit their loved ones and the communities who suffer from the often very difficult consequences of substance misuse.


Rosanna O’Connor, Director of Drugs, Alcohol, Tobacco and Justice at Public Health England said:


  Those sleeping rough with substance misuse problems can find it difficult to access services that can help them - their health continues to deteriorate and it becomes harder for them to turn their lives around.

  This grant will help people who sleep rough struggling with addiction to improve their health and break this pattern and we are looking forward to seeing the positive impact this will have now and in the future.


Steve Douglas CBE, Chief Executive of St Mungo’s said:


  Our own Knocked Back research published earlier this year shows how it has become increasingly difficult for people sleeping rough to access the substance misuse services they need. We also found that drug overdoses were one of the main causes of death of people who do sleep rough.

  We are pleased that the government is targeting funding to tackle this urgent issue alongside other efforts to reduce the number of people sleeping on the streets.

  This year we have seen what is possible when a coordinated multi-agency approach to providing support is taken. And we at St Mungo’s will continue to work with national and local government, and our local partners, to build on these successes and enable as many people as possible to get the help and support they need to recover from homelessness.

Bill allows UK to implement its own Private International Law agreements
  10-year strategy to capitalise on this new freedom published shortly


These agreements help to resolve a range of legal disputes – from returning children abducted by a parent, settling international business disagreements, to helping prevent a spouse living abroad dodging child maintenance obligations.

A public consultation on a 10-year strategy which seeks to capitalise on the UK’s regained capability in this area of law will be published shortly.

It will provide a blueprint for maintaining Britain’s status as a leading global jurisdiction for businesses to operate in, by giving them the legal certainty they need.  It will also ensure that consumers and families have access to the most effective ways of resolving disputes in an ever-more globalised world.

Lord Chancellor Robert Buckland said:


  These agreements provide vital protections to UK businesses, individuals and families looking to live, work, travel and trade across borders.

  We can now enjoy the freedom of being able to strike and implement our own Private International Law deals, ensuring they continue to have the interests of UK citizens at heart.


Without the ability to implement these agreements in domestic law, there could be parallel court cases in different countries, leading to conflicting decisions where UK individuals, businesses and families would bear the brunt of legal costs.

The Bill also maintains three key existing agreements, known as Hague Conventions, to ensure their clear implementation at the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020, and will enable the implementation of the Lugano Convention 2007, should the UK’s application to re-join it be successful. 

It provides an overarching legislative framework, enabling individual private international law (PIL) agreements to be implemented via secondary legislation now the UK has left the EU.

Notes to editors

The Private International Law Bill (2020) received Royal Assent today. It allows the UK to secure its own Private International Law (PIL) agreements now the UK has left the EU.
  PIL agreements cover aspects of civil, family and commercial law, with a real and lasting impacts on people’s lives. PIL agreements could mean, for example
    child maintenance obligations imposed in one country can be recognised and enforced in another
      UK citizens can have confidence that if they travel, buy goods or have an accident abroad there is a way to resolve any legal disputes that may arise.
      businesses can feel confident entering into cross-border transactions, knowing that in the event of a dispute, there is a clear framework of rules for resolving it
      divorces can be recognised in other countries
      children abducted by one of their parents can be returned to their home country, and
      businesses can feel confident entering into cross-border transactions, knowing that in the event of a dispute, there is a clear framework of rules for resolving it.
    
  Beyond underpinning future deals, the Bill simplifies the implementation of three existing Hague Conventions at the end of the Transition Period:
    1996 Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in Respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children: Helps resolve issues around residence and contact with children where parents live in different countries
      2005 Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements: Offers legal certainty in some cross-border contractual disputes by deciding which court should hear a case and enabling the decision to be recognised and enforced in another country
      2007 Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance: Guarantees international recovery of child support and other forms of family maintenance across borders.

New scheme to help adults across England facing multiple disadvantages like homelessness and mental health issues
  Local partnerships will provide joined-up support for better outcomes
  Lessons learned from ‘Changing Futures’ scheme will inform national policy


A £46 million scheme to provide more effective and coordinated support for some of the most vulnerable people in our communities was launched today (10 December 2020) by Minister for Rough Sleeping and Housing Kelly Tolhurst.

The government is inviting local organisations to form partnerships and bid for a share of the funding to better support those who experience multiple disadvantages including homelessness, substance misuse, mental health issues, domestic abuse, and contact with the criminal justice system.

These people are among the most vulnerable in our communities, facing entrenched disadvantage and trauma. They often experience difficulties in getting the coordinated support from local services that they need.

This can lead to increased reoffending, greater risk of rough sleeping and ill-health and can result in a higher demand and costs for local response services and the criminal justice system.

The ‘Changing Futures’ programme aims to establish new, innovative and co-ordinated ways to better support vulnerable adults. The prospectus, published today, invites expressions of interest from organisations such as councils, health bodies, police, probation services, voluntary and community sector organisations to form local partnerships.

Minister for Rough Sleeping and Housing, Kelly Tolhurst said:


  This £46 million funding will help some of the most vulnerable people in our communities turn their lives around and build a brighter future.

  The ‘Changing Futures’ programme gives local organisations the flexibility and resources they need to work in partnership to deliver effective support where it is needed most. I look forward to receiving really innovative bids for projects that will make a real difference to so many people’s lives


The Programme, announced at the Budget, aims to deliver improvements at the individual, service and system level:

for individuals, to stabilise and then improve the life situation of adults who face multiple disadvantage
  for services, to better integrate local services to provide a person-centred approach and to reduce demand on reactive services
  for the local system, to test a different approach to funding, accountability and engagement between local commissioners and services, and central government and local areas
The programme will run alongside evaluation, applying learning from local areas to national policymaking, aiming to deliver better outcomes with taxpayers’ money.

Extra £68 million to help adapt homes for people with disabilities in England
  More than 280,000 home adaptions provided through the Disabled Facilities Grant
  Details of £4 billion Better Care Fund confirmed to better integrate health and social care


An extra £68 million will help thousands more disabled people to access grants to improve their homes so they can live independently, Minister for Rough Sleeping and Housing Kelly Tolhurst has announced today (3 December 2020), the International Day of People with Disabilities.

The additional funding for councils will help people make the adaptations they need to live safely and independently in their own homes.

The Disabled Facilities Grant funding can be used towards the costs of home adaptations such as stair-lifts, level access showers, wet rooms, winches, grab rails and ramps. These can play a critical role in avoiding the need for hospital or care home admission, as well as helping to speed-up discharge from hospital.

This funding is in addition to the £505 million paid to councils in May 2020, increasing the overall government investment in the Disabled Facilities Grant to £573 million this year.

With Spending Review 2020 investment of £573 million in the Disabled Facilities Grant for 2021 to 2022, government has now confirmed over £4 billion funding for the grant since 2010.

This is part of the government’s comprehensive programme to better integrate health and social care services. Today details of the £4 billion Better Care Fund were also confirmed – setting out how councils may use this funding to deliver effective care and support for people in their communities.

Minister for Rough Sleeping and Housing, Kelly Tolhurst said:


  I’m pleased that extra funding announced today, on the International Day of People with Disabilities, will see thousands more people benefit.  This grant can be literally life changing and lengthening, helping more people to live independently in their own homes.

  Since 2012 over 280,000 home adaptions have been funded through the Disabled Facilities Grant Scheme helping many tens of thousands of people to live at home independently.


Minister for Care, Helen Whately said:


  This grant will help hundreds of thousands of disabled people across England to live more independently in their own homes and improve their quality of life.

  I know this year has been incredibly difficult for disabled people in particular and I’m pleased that, on the International Day of People with Disabilities, we’re able to provide this additional funding.

  The Disabled Facilities Grant is a really important part of our ambition to reduce health inequalities and support more people to live healthy, independent lives for as long as possible.


The Disabled Facilities Grant forms part of the Better Care Fund, a fund which brings together local government and health partners to jointly plan and pool budgets to support integrated care.

The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated how health and social care systems can come together and focus on the public’s health and care needs. This announcement is part of the government’s ongoing work to address disparities across society, and its commitment to ensuring that health and care systems work effectively together at a local level, and the Better Care Fund is a key part of this integration.

"182",2020-12-03,"The Environment Agency’s modern and free Flood Warning Service has proved so effective that sirens in Grimsby and Cleethorpes are to be decommissioned.","
    
          More than 80% of the 33,000 properties at risk of flooding in the area now receive advanced warnings through the direct-messaging service, making the old sirens redundant.

The towns’ 18 flood sirens were installed in 2006 to help warn the vast majority of at-risk properties that – at the time – were not yet signed up to the then-fledgling Flood Warning Service.

Sirens now redundant

Now, 14 years later, that service’s advanced-warning messages are delivered to around 3,750 more properties than the sirens were ever able to reach, with more accurate, tailored and reliable messages than the sirens could.

Using the latest forecasting and modelling techniques, the Flood Warning Service alerts people to the possibility of flooding many hours – and sometimes days – in advance.

It sends timely, tailored, location-specific messages with exact details of what to expect, when, and how to react.

Sign up to stay alert

Those messages can be sent via a choice of text, landline, mobile and email – or any combination of those methods up to a maximum selection of five. For example, text messages to two mobiles, emails to two addresses, and an automated call to a landline.

It is a far cry from a short-notice, potentially confusing siren containing no specifics and no advice, and with no guarantee of being heard.

Since the Flood Warning Service launched in 2006, the Environment Agency and its partners have been continuously transforming it, making the best use of the latest technology to better reach people living, working and travelling through flood-risk areas.

World-class warning service

Innovations include automated warning messages to mobile phones registered with certain providers, and becoming one of the first European countries to use Google Public Alerts to display live flood warnings on Google searches and Google Maps, just seconds after they have been issued.

The advances combine to make England’s Flood Warning Service among the best in the world – and the sirens out-dated.

Ben Thornely, flood risk manager at the Environment Agency, said:


  We know how devastating flooding can be, and we want people to have the most accurate and timely information when flooding is expected.

  The best way of doing that is via our free, reliable Flood Warning Service, which gives people clear, specific advice on how to protect themselves, their loved ones and their homes. This just isn’t possible with sirens.

  It takes just a minute to check online if you’re at risk of flooding and to sign up for warnings. We urge people to do that now via GOV.UK/Flood or by calling 0345 988 1188.

  Doing so can reduce the impact of flooding – saving you thousands of pounds.


Cllr Stewart Swinburn, North East Lincolnshire Council’s cabinet member for the environment, said:


  We’ve been kept up-to-date with the Environment Agency’s plans for the flood sirens and they’ve also held two virtual sessions with councillors to explain their proposals. Those sessions have allowed us to inform the Environment Agency’s approach and we’ve stressed the need for local people to be given all the information they require to adapt to the changes with the sirens.

  We’re aware similar system updates have worked well in other areas and we share the Environment Agency’s expectation that advances in technology will make it easier for people to get any flood messages as quickly as possible should the need arise.


To give the best service, the Flood Warning Service relies on people choosing to sign up. It takes around a minute to do so, and can help reduce flooding’s impact and damage – saving potentially thousands of pounds.


People are urged to sign up now via 0345 988 1188 or GOV.UK/Flood, where there is also information on the practical things people can do to protect their businesses, homes and valuables.


Prepare for flooding

Checking if you live in an area at high risk of flooding, preparing a bag with medication and important documents, and moving valuable and sentimental items upstairs or to a safe place can reduce the damage caused by a flood by around 40%.

Since the sirens were installed in 2006, the Environment Agency has invested around £20m into the area’s flood defences. That includes a £19m upgrade along the Humber and at the port of Grimsby, and improvements along the River Freshney. Further work between Immingham and Grimsby is expected to begin in 2022.

The Environment Agency plans to stop using the flood sirens from 31 December 2020.

Background

The Flood Warning Service currently reaches 83% of at-risk properties in the area, compared to the 72% of at-risk properties within audible range of a siren. Even those in range of a siren may not hear them because of things like wind direction and double glazing.
  The average cost of repairing a flood-damaged home is around £32,000.
  33,235 homes are at risk of flooding across the area. - 27,735 (around 83%) are reached by the Flood Warning Service. 5,500 (around 17%) are not reached by the Flood Warning Service and need to sign up. 23,997 (72%) are in range of a siren but not guaranteed to hear it or know how to react.
  5.2 million properties are at risk of flooding in England. People are urged to visit GOV.UK/Flood, check if they’re at risk, and make sure they know what to do if it floods.
  In many flood risk areas, people can sign up for flood warnings. These warn of the risk of flooding from rivers, the sea and groundwater. They’ll alert people by phone, email or text when flooding is expected.
  The best way for people to protect themselves from flooding is to know what to do in advance – they can download and save a simple Prepare, Act, Survive plan so they know what to do when there’s a flood warning in their area.
  The National Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy was adopted in Autumn 2020 and sets the blueprint for how the Environment Agency and other organisations will manage flood and coastal change from now until 2100.

"183",2020-11-10,"Part of the Trans Pennine Trail is re-opening in Hull after an upgrade to flood defences on the Victoria Dock Village western frontage.","
    
          A popular section of footpath, which is part of the Trans Pennine Trail, is re-opening after an upgrade to flood defences on Hull’s Victoria Dock Village western frontage.

The majority of the path will open this week so that people can walk along the estuary front from The Deep up to the corner at the Half Tide Basin.
These improvements are part of the £42 million tidal flood defence scheme for Hull. The new defences will improve tidal flood protection for 113,000 homes and businesses.

Led by the Environment Agency, the Humber Hull Frontage scheme is upgrading seven kilometres of flood defences along the estuary frontage through the city of Hull.

This work is being carried out at eight locations including St Andrew’s Quay Retail Park, Victoria Pier and Victoria Dock Village. Work on the scheme is scheduled to be completed by Spring 2021.

Project manager Helen Tattersdale, from the Environment Agency, said:


  To progress with our construction work, we had to temporarily close a section of the Trans Pennine Trail along the frontage promenade and divert pedestrians along South Bridge Road. We appreciate this has been inconvenient for local people and visitors and we’re delighted that we can re-open this popular route again.



  Even though we are working hard to improve the flood defences to protect this area of Hull, we can never completely prevent flooding. I do urge residents and businesses to check they are signed up to our free flood warning service and look into the practical steps they can take to protect themselves by having their own flood plan.


Councillor Mike Thompson, portfolio holder for neighbourhoods, communities and environment at Hull City Council, said:


  Since this area of the city underwent a significant amount of regeneration, it has seen a huge increase in footfall. As well as attracting visitors to the Marina and docks, it also forms part of the TransPennine Trail walking route.



  Hull has strong links to the water and estuary but we obviously need to be aware of the challenges this brings, particularly relating to climate change.  This scheme is just one of the many steps we can all take to reduce flood risk and become a resilient city.



  Whilst making these significant improvements to flood protection for Hull, we want to increase awareness of this riverside walking route and make it attractive and enjoyable for residents and visitors alike.


In Victoria Dock Village – West, a new concrete flood defence wall has been constructed and flood gates have been installed at Camilla Close, Ocean Boulevard and Plimsoll Way.

Original paving stones have been used to re-lay the footpath. Glazed panels are due to be installed in some locations to ensure the new wall does not obscure views of The Humber. There is also some landscaping yet to take place.

There is a small section of footpath on the western edge of the Half Tide Basin which will remain closed in the short term. This is to allow the flood glass to be fitted into the flood defence wall when it is received from the manufacturer.

This critical work is essential to maintaining and improving Hull’s flood defences, and is being carried out in accordance with government guidelines for safe working due to the Covid-19 outbreak.

Contractor BMM-JV (a joint venture between BAM Nuttall & Mott MacDonald) was employed by the Environment Agency to started at Victoria Dock Village in May 2019 The work is being carried out in two sections: Victoria Dock Village – West which  extends from the Half Tide Basin towards The Deep and Victoria Dock Village – East which extends from the Half Tide Basin towards Corinthian Way.

All sections of the Humber Hull Frontages flood defence improvements scheme are expected to be completed in spring next year.

Environment Agency flood schemes protected almost 130,000 properties during the winter 2019/20 flooding. However, there are 5.2 million homes and businesses in England at risk of flooding. The average cost of flooding to a home is £30k and the mental health-impacts long-lasting.

Today starts the Environment Agency’s Flood Action Week (9 – 15 November) – an annual flood awareness campaign aimed at providing essential advice about what people can do to better protect themselves.

Taking some simple steps to prepare and knowing what to do in a flood can not only save lives but significantly reduce the damages to a home and possessions by around 40 percent.

"184",2020-11-08,"Children and families will get extra support this winter, with councils given new funding to ensure vulnerable households do not go hungry or without essential items.","
    
          £170m Covid Winter Grant Scheme to support children, families and the most vulnerable over winter
  Holiday Activities and Food programme to be expanded, covering Easter, Summer and Christmas in 2021
  Healthy Start payments set to rise from £3.10 to £4.25 a week from April 2021
  Suite of measures represents long-term plan to help tackle poor health, hunger and education.
Building on the significant support given to the most vulnerable during the pandemic, a new £170m Covid Winter Grant Scheme will be run by councils in England.

The funding will be ring-fenced, with at least 80% earmarked to support with food and bills, and will cover the period to the end of March 2021. Local Authorities will receive the funding at the beginning of December 2020.

It will allow councils to directly help the hardest-hit families and individuals, as well as provide food for children who need it over the holidays. Local councils understand which groups need support, and are best placed to ensure appropriate holiday support is provided – which is why they will distribute the funds, rather than schools, who will continue providing meals for disadvantaged children during term-time.

The Holiday Activities and Food programme, which has provided healthy food and enriching activities to disadvantaged children since 2018, will also be expanded across England next year.

It will cover Easter, Summer and Christmas in 2021, and cost up to £220m. It will be available to children in every local authority in England, building on previous programmes – including this summers, which supported around 50,000 children across 17 local authorities.

Healthy Start scheme payments are also set to increase from £3.10 to £4.25 a week from next April, 2021.

This scheme supports pregnant women or those with children under four who have a low income and are in receipt of benefits to buy fresh fruit and vegetables. This will help people boost the long-term health of their children.

The Government has also pledged additional funding of £16m for food distribution charities, with conversations with FareShare and others ongoing as to how this is allocated.

Work and Pensions Secretary, Thérèse Coffey, said:


  We want to make sure vulnerable people feel cared for throughout this difficult time and, above all, no one should go hungry or be unable to pay their bills this winter.



  We know this has been a challenging time for many, and we have consistently supported the lowest-paid families, protecting 9 million jobs with furlough and boosting welfare support by £9.3 billion.



  This package builds on that support, and by extending our successful Holiday Activities and Food programme, as well as funding a £170 million Covid Winter Grant Scheme, we are making sure families get the help they need.


The government has acknowledged that school holidays can be difficult for some families, with children at risk of missing out on healthy meals, activities, and learning opportunities.

For example, learning loss over summer accounts for almost two-thirds of the attainment gap between the richest and the poorest children by age 14.

For this reason, up to £220m is being invested in the Holiday Activities and Food programme, with disadvantaged children able to get healthy food and take part in fun enriching activities over summer, Christmas and Easter in 2021.

Ministers have also taken unprecedented measures during the pandemic to protect the most vulnerable, and put in place a strong package of financial support to support families and children.

This includes:

Protecting millions of jobs and livelihoods through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme, which have been extended until March 2021
  Increasing Universal Credit and Tax Credits by up to £20 a week this year
  £63m for councils to provide emergency assistance to families, pensioners and the most vulnerable with food, essentials and meals
  Extending free school meals support to those eligible when schools closed during lockdown
  Increasing Local Housing Allowance rates for Universal Credit and housing benefit claimants, so it covers the lowest 30% of local rents – benefiting over 1 million households by on average £600 this year.
Local authorities understand which groups need support, and are best placed to ensure appropriate holiday support is provided – which is why the £170m Covid Winter Grant Scheme will be distributed by them, rather than schools, who will continue providing meals disadvantaged children during term-time.

"185",2020-10-20,"Criminals in Wales who commit alcohol-fuelled crimes can be banned from drinking and ordered to wear a ‘sobriety tag’ by judges from today (Wednesday 21 October) and will be extended to England early next year.","
    
          

Tags in force from today in Wales, extended to England next year
  Tags will monitor compliance with alcohol bans handed down by courts as part of community sentences
  New technology will help tackle root cause of criminal behaviour to reduce reoffending


The tags monitor offenders’ sweat every 30 minutes and alert the probation service if alcohol is consumed. Not complying with their alcohol abstinence order – new powers allowing courts to issue drinking bans for up to 120 days – could see them back in court for further sentencing or facing fines.

It is the latest boost to the Government’s plans to make community sentences more robust, a tougher punishment while also making criminals less likely to reoffend. Last month, the Lord Chancellor set out reforms to make community orders stricter and expand the use of electronic monitoring.

Alcohol is a factor in around 39% of violent crime, with the social and economic cost of alcohol-related harm stretching to over £21 billion per year. It is seen as one of the driving influencers of domestic violence and unprovoked attacks on strangers. That is why the sobriety tags will be backed up by targeted professional support, signposting offenders to the help they need to improve their lifestyle and rein in their drinking. Referrals to treatment will continue to be made for those with more serious alcohol addictions who commit crimes.

Minister for Crime and Policing, Kit Malthouse MP said:


  All too often we see the devastating effects of alcohol-fuelled behaviour, reckless crimes and casual violence which blight our neighbourhoods and the lives of too many victims.



  This proven new tool can break the self-destructive cycle that offenders end up in, helping them sober up if they choose to and the courts to punish those who don’t.


The scheme follows two successful pilots in London and across Humberside, Lincolnshire and North Yorkshire which showed that offenders were alcohol free on over 97% of the days monitored. Wearers also reported a positive impact on their lives, wellbeing and behaviour.

At present, abstinence orders can last for four months but we are looking at whether they should be able to last longer as part of our sentencing reforms.

The tags alert staff when they have been tampered with and can distinguish between drinks and other types of alcohol – such as hand sanitiser or perfume. They work 24/7 and can also tell if someone tries to block contact between the tag and their skin.

Secretary of State for Wales Simon Hart said:


  Alcohol can have a devastating impact on lives and figures show it is a key factor behind far too many crimes.



  I am encouraged to see Wales at the forefront of implementing this new technology, which we believe will contribute towards lowering reoffending rates, making our streets safer and supporting those who need help.


The Government’s plans to overhaul sentencing will see dangerous offenders spend longer in prison, while greater efforts are made to tackle the root causes of offending. More support will be on offer for those willing to turn their back on crime through treatment for mental health issues and addictions. Supervision of offenders in the community will be improved with greater powers for probation officers and increased curfews. The Government also plans to use GPS tags to track burglars, robbers and thieves when they are released from prison.

"186",2020-09-29,"£27 million has been announced for mental health charity Think Ahead to expand their mental health social work graduate programme.","
    
          Up to 480 mental health social workers will be recruited and trained – with applications open today (29 September)
  More than 10,000 people living with serious mental illness will receive support
More than 10,000 people living with serious mental illness will receive support from 480 new mental health social workers, thanks to a £27 million funding boost for the charity Think Ahead.

The new funding – which has been welcomed by mental health charity Mind – will help recruit and train a new wave of mental health social workers, who will form a vital part of the response to coronavirus. Applications for the graduate places have opened today.

The recruits are trained to provide psychological and practical support to help people with serious mental illness, such as severe depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and address issues such as relationships, housing and employment, which can have a huge bearing on mental wellbeing.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on mental health – and recent research suggests that those with pre-existing mental health conditions are at greater risk of significant, long-term negative effects.[footnote 1]

This new funding will give the most vulnerable the support they need by expanding the Think Ahead programme by 60% – from 100 trainees each year to 160 – training up to 480 new mental health social workers across England over the next 3 years.

Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Nadine Dorries said:


  The impact of the pandemic on those with pre-existing mental health conditions could be significant and long lasting.

  The NHS, local services and charities have done an excellent job in being there to support those who have needed help throughout the pandemic, but it is vital that we ensure our services are fit to meet ongoing demand.

  By expanding the mental health workforce this new funding will boost support for the most vulnerable at a time when they need it most.


Think Ahead Chief Executive, Ella Joseph, said:


  We are delighted to be able to train hundreds more social workers, who will play a key part in the nation’s mental health recovery from coronavirus.

  The pandemic has shown us more than ever that social factors like isolation, relationships, finances and living arrangements have profound impacts on mental health – social workers are uniquely placed to help people with severe mental health problems to address issues like these.


The Think Ahead programme offers talented graduates and those looking to change career a paid route into frontline mental health services, run by the NHS and local authorities, with training delivered on the job in partnership with Middlesex University.

The programme, which began in 2016, has been a huge success, and so far has recruited over 500 mental health social workers. It is recognised in the Times Top 100 Graduate Employers list as one of the top 40 graduate schemes in the country, and receives more than 30 applications for each place.

Applications for the 2021 intake have opened today, with the selection process focusing on the motivation and skills to make a difference to vulnerable people.

Paul Farmer, Chief Executive of Mind, said:


  It’s great to see further funding for Think Ahead. The programme is supporting people who want to become mental health social workers and change the lives of people who experience serious mental health problems.

  People’s social circumstances – such as their finances, living arrangements and relationships – are crucial to good mental health. That has become even more clear this year as the coronavirus has had a deep impact on many people’s lives.


Claire Murdoch, NHS England’s National Director of Mental Health Director, said:


  Expanding mental health care for patients, including by boosting our workforce, is an important priority for the NHS so it’s absolutely good news that the Think Ahead programme is being enhanced, recognising that its trainees have already supported thousands of people across dozens of NHS mental health trusts in England.

  Mental health social workers have a vital role to play in helping to ensure that people receive the mental health and care support they need, as the NHS continues to deliver care to people who need it, as we have done throughout the pandemic.


Background information

Think Ahead

Think Ahead is an independent charity. Its flagship graduate programme, funded by the Department of Health and Social Care, offers talented graduates and career-changers a route to train on the job as mental health social workers.

To date the charity has recruited more than 500 new entrants for over 60% of England’s NHS mental health trusts and 30% of local authorities, across every region of England.

Today’s announcement

Think Ahead has been awarded a contract for up to £27 million from DHSC:

This contract will fund at least 2 more intakes of the 2-year programme, starting in summer 2021 and summer 2022, and costing just over £9 million each. The contract includes an optional extension to a third intake
  Each intake will recruit and train up to 160 social workers. This is a 60% increase in size, as previous intakes each took around 100 participants
  We estimate that recruits from the first 2 intakes (i.e. those guaranteed by the contract) will support at least 10,000 service users by 2025. This is a conservative estimate based on average numbers of service users that participants from our previous intakes have worked with
The impact of mental health problems

Mental illness affects 1 in 4 adults in England each year. It has the same effect on life expectancy as smoking, and overall costs the UK over £100 billion a year in healthcare and lost productivity. See more information on the national scale and effects of mental illness.

How the Think Ahead programme works

Think Ahead participants undergo an intensive 2-year programme that blends on-the-job experience with academic learning and leadership training. Participants become qualified after their first year on the programme, and complete a master’s degree during their second year.

Financial support

In the first year, participants receive a tax-free training bursary of £17,200 outside London or £19,100 inside London. In the second year, they are employed as a newly qualified social worker and receive a taxable salary. This will typically range from £21,000 to £33,000, depending on location.

Academic qualifications

Middlesex University leads Think Ahead’s teaching and curriculum (and awards the degrees to participants).

Selection process

Applicants must have (or be on course for) a 2:1 undergraduate degree in any subject. Candidates who meet the academic criteria go through a rigorous 3-stage assessment process focused on 7 key attributes, which includes a role-play social work situation and an interview with someone who uses mental health services.


  
      Research published by the Centre for Mental Health suggests that half a million more people in the UK may experience mental ill health as a result of COVID-19 (see the COVID-19 and the nation’s mental health report) and that those with pre-existing mental health conditions are at greater risk of significant, long term negative effects (see the COVID-19: understanding inequalities in mental health during the pandemic report). ↩

"187",2020-09-16,"New legislation will help ex-offenders to find a job – allowing them to turn their lives around and ending the cycle of crime.","
    
          

reforms to remove barrier to employment and reduce reoffending
  time it takes certain convictions to become ‘spent’ reduced
  changes will not apply to sensitive roles or most serious offenders


Under new proposals announced today (16 September 2020), the time it takes for certain convictions to become ‘spent’ will be reduced so that they are no longer automatically disclosed on employment checks. This will only happen after a period of rehabilitation has been successfully completed, allowing offenders who have turned their backs on crime a fair chance of employment again.

Custodial sentences of up to a year will become spent after a further 12 months without reoffending, while convictions between 1 and 4 years will no longer be disclosed after four crime-free years. Previously, such offences would continue to be shared with employers for up to four and seven years respectively.

To ensure this does not result in an increased risk to the public, these changes will not apply to those that have committed serious sexual, violent or terrorist offences and those working in sensitive roles such as teaching or nursing.

Reoffending costs the taxpayer around £18 billion per year and there are few better ways of reducing it than the security of a regular income.  However, many former offenders find it almost impossible to get a job with just 17% in P45 employment a year after release and more than half of employers saying they would not consider hiring someone with a criminal record.

These reforms will remove a disproportionate barrier to employment which prevents ex-offenders from moving on with their lives. For example, someone handed a five-year sentence for theft 30 years ago that still has to disclose their crime despite never reoffending.

Once a  7 year period of rehabilitation has been served, sentences of more than 4 years will no longer be automatically disclosed to employers. Currently, details of such offences must be shared with employers for the remainder of an offender’s life – even if the crimes were committed decades earlier, or as a child.

Children’s rehabilitation periods will continue to be half that of adults, recognising that children who offend are often highly vulnerable and are still maturing.

However, any individual that reoffends during their rehabilitation period will have to disclose both their original and subsequent offences to employers for the duration of whichever rehabilitation period is longer.

Housing Secretary launches billions of pounds of new investment in housing to help the country build back better, including homes for social rent to help the most vulnerable
  Half of the new homes being made available for ownership and revamped Shared Ownership scheme to help the next generation onto the property ladder
  Consultation launched to make all new homes more accessible for older and disabled people


Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has today (8 September 2020) announced that the prospectus inviting bids for the government’s massive investment in affordable housing and new measures to make it easier to get a foot on the property ladder are being launched this week.

In total, the new programme represents the highest single funding commitment to affordable housing in a decade.

The £12.2 billion overall investment in affordable housing was confirmed at Budget, which also includes £700 million on new homes through the 2016 to 2022 programme.

A new £11.5 billion Affordable Homes Programme will be delivered over 5 years from 2021 to 2026, providing up to 180,000 new homes across the country, should economic conditions allow.

The programme will unlock a further £38 billion in public and private investment in affordable housing. New homes will be made available from next year.

Today, the government is announcing that around half of the new homes will be available for affordable home ownership, helping even more people to get a foot on the housing ladder.

In order to support people from all backgrounds, the rest will be made available for discounted rent, including 10% for supported housing – to support those with physical or mental health challenges.

Nearly £7.5 billion will be delivered outside London by Homes England, the government’s housing accelerator. This is over £2 billion more than the amount given under the previous Affordable Homes Programme, underlining the government’s commitment to levelling up the whole country.

The Greater London Authority has been offered £4 billion and negotiations about what they will deliver with this funding are in progress.

Homes England will publish their Affordable Homes Programme prospectus this week, inviting councils, housing associations and private providers to start preparing their bids. New homes will be delivered from next year.

Housing Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:


  Today’s announcement represents the highest single funding commitment to affordable housing in a decade and is part of our comprehensive plans to build back better.

  This government is helping hard-working families and prospective first-time buyers get their feet on the housing ladder in an affordable way.

  Thanks to the range of flexible ownership options being made available, more families across the country will be able to realise their dreams of owning their own home, with half of these homes being made available for ownership.


As well as delivering homes for affordable ownership, the new programme will deliver homes for Affordable and Social Rent. Funding for Social Rent, which is typically 50 to 60% of market prices, will be available to housing providers across the country, providing secure, affordable housing to families who need it most.

Today the Housing Secretary is also announcing a new model for Shared Ownership to help more people onto the property ladder by vastly reducing the minimum initial share, and launching a consultation to ensure new homes deliver the accessibility that families need.

The new Shared Ownership model announced today will:

reduce the minimum initial share you can buy in a property from 25% to 10%
  allow people to buy additional shares in their home in 1% instalments, with heavily reduced fees
  introduce a 10-year period for new shared owners where the landlord will cover the cost of any repairs and maintenance
A Right to Shared Ownership will be available on the vast majority of rented homes delivered through the new programme, providing tenants with a pathway into ownership by giving them the right to purchase a stake in their home.

Additionally, the Housing Secretary has today launched a consultation to consider how best to raise accessibility standards for all new homes in recognition of the importance of suitable homes for older and disabled people.

Nick Walkley, Chief Executive of Homes England, said:


  We welcome the launch of the new Affordable Homes fund, which gives Homes England a unique opportunity to work on behalf of the government to accelerate the delivery of high-quality, affordable homes.

  The fund will support improved productivity in construction and unlock new economic opportunities across the country. Despite the challenges of COVID-19, this long-term funding settlement gives our partners the confidence they need to invest in new homes and the communities they work for.


Today’s announcements follow proposals unveiled last month to overhaul the country’s outdated planning system, including a new and simpler system of developer contributions to ensure firms play their part in funding affordable homes.

A new Infrastructure Levy has been proposed that would deliver more funding for affordable housing, including at least as many affordable homes as the current system.

More than 1.5 million new homes have been delivered since 2010, including more than 460,000 affordable homes. More than 644,000 households have been helped to purchase a home since spring 2010 through government schemes including Shared Ownership, Help to Buy Equity Loans, Help to Buy ISAs and Right to Buy.

Building the homes the country needs is a priority for the government to ensure everyone can live in a decent, accessible and secure home, and to support our recovery from the impact of coronavirus.

That’s why recent government support for the sector includes supporting smaller developers with an extra £450 million through the Home Building Fund, providing £400 million to build new homes on brownfield land and proposing an overhaul of the planning system to streamline the process cut red tape and harness technology to deliver homes faster.

"189",2020-09-04,"Demonstration of collision avoidance system sees 2 vehicles steer around stationary car without human assistance.","
    
          
A UK government-backed consortium has achieved a ‘world first’ by demonstrating a collision-avoidance system in which 2 vehicles co-operate by radio link to steer around a stationary car without human assistance.

The successful live demo at Bruntingthorpe Proving Ground in Leicestershire is a significant milestone in developing a driver aid to avoid multi-vehicle collisions, particularly motorway pile-ups.

It was the climax of a 32-month project called MuCCA (Multi-Car Collision Avoidance), led by Applus IDIADA and involving 5 other automotive industry, technology and research partners. This £4.6 million project was jointly funded by the Centre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CCAV) and delivered through Innovate UK.

There were 1,870 road deaths in the UK to June 2019 and human error is a factor in 95% of accidents.

Acting autonomously, vehicles equipped with MuCCA technology figure out between them what to do when confronted with an obstacle or a likely collision. If an accident is unavoidable, the MuCCA system will intervene to minimise injuries and damage. In normal traffic, the technology could help to reduce the bunching and congestion on motorways which is costly to the UK economy.

MuCCA incorporates 3 key elements:

sensing of the immediate environment around the vehicle
  automatic steering as well as automatic braking
  live vehicle-to-vehicle radio messaging, communicating 50 times a second
The autonomous vehicles cooperate in real-time – something humans cannot do – and can manoeuvre to give another car the space to avoid an obstacle. With sophisticated machine learning algorithms developed at Cranfield University, MuCCA can even predict how non-autonomous vehicles with human drivers are likely to react. The next stage of development will focus on refining the control systems and extending simulation testing to more tricky scenarios and higher speeds.

"190",2020-09-03,"Lab capacity to continue to increase ahead of winter, with a new Lighthouse Lab set to open near Loughborough by the end of September.","
    
          
    NHS Test and Trace continues to reach the majority of those testing positive and their contacts in week 13 of operation
  
  
    Brand new large-scale technology to increase the number of tests that NHS and Lighthouse Labs can process is being introduced
  
A new Lighthouse Lab near Loughborough will join Britain’s largest network of diagnostic testing facilities in history to increase coronavirus testing capacity.

The new lab will be brought into the lab network this month and will be able to process around 50,000 tests per day by the end of the year.

This comes as the weekly statistics from NHS Test and Trace show that the service continues to reach the majority of those testing positive and their contacts, in week 13 reaching 80% of contacts where contact information was available.

Demand for testing continues to rise, with those tested for the first time increasing by 63% since mid-June.

The new lab is part of plans to scale up testing capacity to 500,000 swab tests per day by the end October. There is currently capacity for 350,000 tests each day in the UK, across all 4 testing pillars including antibody tests and surveillance studies. The growth in demand means that existing capacity for pillar 2 swab tests is being fully utilised and in line with existing plans, the capacity is being quickly expanded.

Alongside increased Lighthouse Lab capacity, brand new large-scale processing units are being rolled out for use across both NHS and Lighthouse Labs.

Today £500 million has been announced to increase capacity and roll out new cutting-edge testing technology to deliver rapid tests. Chains of transmission will be broken almost immediately by delivering on-the-spot results. Successful trials will then be expanded and rolled out further, with new tests being used in Salford, Southampton and Hampshire over the coming weeks.

NHS Test and Trace continues to focus efforts to uplift testing by working closely with local authorities and communities where there is high prevalence of the virus.

Interim Executive Chair of the National Institute for Public Health, Baroness Dido Harding, said:


  NHS Test and Trace has been operating for more than 3 months and during that time it has consistently reached the majority of those testing positive and their contacts, almost 330,000 people at risk of unknowingly passing the virus on.

  As the service has become part of our everyday lives, demand for testing has increased. To meet this, we continue our efforts to build and scale testing capacity to reach 500,000 tests per day by the end of October by making use of new tests, new labs and new technology.

  Thanks to all the people who have come forward for a free test, and the vital work of local teams around the country making sure people are aware of testing we are breaking chains of transmission. The advice remains the same: if you have symptoms of coronavirus get tested and if you are contacted by NHS Test and Trace, follow the advice you receive.


From this week, the new equipment which will boost processing capacity for each lab beyond 100,000 tests a day will be trialled in the Milton Keynes Lighthouse Lab. The technology will allow labs to process a higher number of test samples simultaneously, reduce costs, and will be able to process saliva-based tests being piloted in Southampton and Salford announced today.

Increased lab capacity across the country will help to further improve test turnaround times while meeting additional demand, with this week’s NHS Test and Trace statistics showing that  84.3% of in-person test results already being returned the day after a test was taken. The median average time it takes for a test result to be returned from a drive-through or walk-through test site is now only 24 hours, or 22 hours at a mobile testing unit.

Since launching in May, the service has reached almost 330,000 people at risk of unknowingly passing the virus on, significantly curbing the spread of coronavirus in England.

These figures demonstrate that NHS Test and Trace continues to perform well against international contact tracing standards.

Statistics from the 13th week of operation of NHS Test and Trace (20 to 26 August) show that since the service launched:


    327,927 people have been reached by the service. This includes both those testing positive and their contacts
  
  
    79.7% of all contacts identified were reached, which increases to 87.7% for those we had contact information for
  
  
    78.5% of people testing positive and transferred to the contact tracing system were reached since launch
  
  
    4,833,347 people have been newly tested under pillars 1 and 2
  
In the latest week (20 to 26 August):


    81.4% of people testing positive and transferred to the contact tracing system were reached
  
  
    80.0% of contacts we had information for were reached
  
  
    452,679 people have been newly tested under pillars 1 and 2
  
Background information

New testing technology is being supplied by LGC to Milton Keynes Lighthouse Lab. Each LGC machine is able to process up to 150,000 tests per day, at reduced cost and speed.

"191",2020-09-03,"A £90,000 project to repair the flood assets at Hampton Bishop in Herefordshire that were damaged in the February floods is now underway.","
    
          The work includes the repair of the 3km long flood embankment of the River Lugg.  The bank was overtopped by the river in the February floods when the Lugg reached its highest level ever recorded.

Storms Ciara, Dennis and Jorge caused extensive disruption and severe impacts with many areas flooded in February.  Two severe flood warnings were in place at Hampton Bishop along the River Wye and River Lugg.
The ground was already sodden from last autumn’s heavy rains and floods and the area quickly became flooded, with many rivers, including the River Wye at Hampton Bishop reaching the highest ever recorded levels.
Despite this, our flood defences protected approximately 150 properties (residential and commercial) in Hampton Bishop, which otherwise would have flooded.

The work at Hampton Bishop also includes repairs to the River Wye embankment, which, whilst it did not overtop in the floods, was damaged by the prolonged high levels of the river. Repairs will also be made to the nearby Mordiford bridge and flood wall to rectify the erosion caused by the February floods.

The Hampton Bishop repair work is one of 41 projects in an £8m flood recovery programme currently in the pipeline across the West Midlands area1 to repair flood defences damaged in the February floods.

Craig Barker, Project Manager for the Environment Agency, said:


  Making sure our flood defences are in a good shape to protect communities is a priority for the Environment Agency. As part of the Hampton Bishop project, work has now started on repairing the flood embankment on the River Lugg to reduce the risk of flooding to the local area. We are expecting to have all of the work we are carrying out in this area completed by November 2020.

  Hampton Bishop is on the confluence of the River Wye and River Lugg, which both reached the highest levels ever recorded in February this year.  Pressure was put on many of our flood defences caused by the high volume of water in both these rivers.

  Since then, whilst adhering to government guidance, we have been inspecting our defences to check for the need for repairs so we can ensure they are ready for any future floods. We have also used drone surveys to help with the process.


Environment Agency teams work around the clock to help protect people from flooding, but flood risk can never be eliminated completely, everyone still has a responsibility to take steps to protect themselves.
Check whether you’re at risk of flooding, and sign up to receive our free flood warnings, or call 0345 988 1188. By registering, you can choose how you’d prefer to be reached – by text, phone call to a mobile or landline, or even email – giving you vital notice to prepare if flooding is expected.

Since the floods in November 2019, the Environment Agency has checked 3,000 flood assets across the West Midlands1 and identified over 95 individual repairs that are required at a cost of £8m, to protect around 4,000 properties.

The repair works are being carried out by the Environment Agency’s contractors, Jackson Civil Engineering.

1 The Environment Agency’s West Midlands’ area includes Shropshire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Gloucestershire, Staffordshire, Birmingham and the Black Country.

Notes to editors

In the February floods 48 properties were flooded or impacted in Hampton Bishop.

The Environment Agency worked as part of an operational team alongside emergency response partners including Herefordshire Council, West Mercia Police, Hereford & Worcester Fire and Rescue Service and health partners to support residents and protect the most vulnerable.

According to Met Office statistics, February 2020 was the wettest February on record for England with double the average monthly rainfall. It was also the 5th wettest of any calendar month since 1862 and some areas experienced a month’s worth of rain in 24 hours.  In England 154.9mm rainfall fell, 258% of the average rainfall for the month. Some places received over 4 times the average monthly rainfall.

          The enhancement to our Local Land Charges (LLC) service is part of a series of changes we are making to improve the customer experience.

Local land charges searches are normally required in the property-buying process. Most local land charges are restrictions or prohibitions on the use of a property, such as planning permissions or listed buildings. A search will reveal whether a property is subject to a charge.

Some customers had commented that search results were overly complicated and revealed too much information. We are continually listening to customer feedback and looking for ways to improve the LLC service. Based on these comments, this service change will improve the user experience by making search results simpler and more accessible.

Mark Edwards, LLC Service Manager


  We have learned so much more from customers and users about how they use HM Land Registry’s Local Land Charges service and what works for them. Following their feedback, the introduction of these changes mean that we can provide a better customer service and reduce some of the work required by users to interpret LLC data. We are engaging with our user groups and are always looking to improve our service design to create the best service possible.


Andrew Prismall, Chairman of the Association of Independent Personal Search Agents (IPSA)


  We are pleased to see that HM Land Registry is acting on feedback to improve its LLC service. When I proposed and recommended these changes to the IPSA membership, they were unanimously approved. Through providing feedback and working with our members, IPSA is proud to continue to collaborate with HM Land Registry to ensure the evolution of the LLC service.


We are continuing to work in partnership local authorities in England to migrate their LLC data to our central, digital register. Once migrated, anyone can get instant online search results for that area using the Search for local land charges service.

The benefits of having immediate access to local land charges search results are greatly appreciated by customers. The average time to complete a search has reduced from 39 days to a few minutes and the cost of an official search will be reduced from the highest fee of £85 to £15. The next local authority to go live on the LLC Register will be Milton Keynes Council on Thursday 27 August .

          Nursing careers made more accessible through ‘earn and learn’ route
  Up to 2,000 nursing apprentices to be trained every year for the next 4 years
Nursing careers in England will be made more accessible through a new government package worth up to £172 million, which will enable healthcare employers to take on up to 2,000 nursing degree apprentices every year over the next 4 years.

The news comes as interest in health careers has surged, with the number of people looking for information on nursing on the NHS careers website rising by 138% between March and June.

Nursing degree apprenticeships provide a route into nursing where people can train to nationally recognised standards and earn as they learn, benefiting those for whom a full-time university course is not practical or preferred.

Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said:


  I’m thrilled to see a rising interest in nursing careers, but we must ensure this fantastic career is truly diverse and open to all.

  Nursing apprenticeships allow students to earn as they learn and this new funding will enable healthcare employers to hire thousands more, helping us to deliver 50,000 more nurses by the end of this Parliament.


Gillian Keegan, Apprenticeships and Skills Minister said:


  Nursing apprenticeships are a brilliant way to start a truly rewarding career with our fantastic NHS.  Nurses are at the heart of our NHS and their care, compassion and support of patients save and transform lives across the country every day.

  This multi-million pound funding boost will help to support thousands of apprentices to gain the skills they need, and earn while they learn. Apprenticeships are an excellent way for anyone, regardless of their background, to kick start their career or to progress.


NHS and other healthcare employers will receive £8,300 per placement per year for both new and existing apprenticeships. Nursing degree apprentices already receive a salary and have their tuition costs paid for through the apprenticeship programme. The funding will enable employers to meet the costs of taking on apprentices, including staffing costs while apprentices are undertaking education and training.

The nursing degree apprenticeship is a 4-year course with placements available in the 4 fields of adult, children, mental health and learning disability, after which students can qualify as fully registered nurses. NHS and social care employers currently train around 1,000 nurse apprentices every year.

In addition to this funding, employers in England will also benefit from a new payment announced last month of £2,000 for each new apprentice they hire aged under 25, and £1,500 for each new apprentice they hire aged 25 and over, up until 31 January 2021.

The news comes the week after the NHS People Plan was published setting out how the NHS will put staff wellbeing at its heart with a new recruitment, retention and support package. It sets out practical support for wellbeing such as safe spaces to rest and recuperate, wellbeing guardians and support to keep staff physically safe and healthy.

Case studies

Adam Cramp, 29, completed a Nursing Degree Apprenticeship at Broadmoor Hospital, part of West London NHS Trust, said:


  This scheme has given me an opportunity that I would never have thought possible. I left school without any A-Levels and worked in retail, security and as a healthcare assistant, where I realised I wanted to support patients and I am now a registered nurse.

  Without this apprenticeship, I would not have been able to get the qualifications I needed due to barriers in attending university, especially as a mature student but now believe that this is the best route into a nursing career regardless of your personal situation.

  The support I’ve received from my trust, my university and my managers is incredible and I even won the Apprentice of the Year Award in 2018. I encourage anybody interested to apply, I’m so thankful that I did.


Sophie Hurcombe, 31, a second-year Nursing Degree Apprentice from South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Trust, said:


  I joined the trust as a healthcare assistant in 2015 and witnessed first-hand the fantastic opportunities and job satisfaction that my qualified nurse colleagues had. When I saw that the trust was advertising nursing apprenticeships, I knew that this would be an amazing opportunity to progress my career.

  As a more mature student, full-time university was not financially realistic for me, so being able to study alongside my role as a healthcare assistant has allowed me to develop my skills and confidence whilst earning a wage.

  The support I have received from colleagues has been invaluable and I would recommend a nursing apprenticeship to anyone thinking about getting their foot on the NHS career ladder.


Dennis Little, Head of Workforce Development and Education at South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Trust, said:


  We introduced the Registered Nurse Degree Apprenticeship to allow experienced healthcare professionals at our trust to train as registered nurses at the University of Sunderland. The programme has allowed our apprentices to utilise the knowledge and experience they have gained through providing high-quality patient care in their nurse training.

  Apprenticeships are a great opportunity for people to develop, who may find it difficult to pursue a traditional university route towards nursing, but demonstrate a natural ability to deliver compassionate care to our patients.

  We are proud to support our current apprentices and look forward to further developing our skilled nursing workforce in the future.


Becky White, 30, a Nursing Degree Apprentice from West London NHS Trust. said:


  I have always wanted to support others with their mental health, and my interest in this grew, working on the rehabilitation wards at Broadmoor Hospital. When they began offering nursing degree apprenticeships, I realised this was the perfect opportunity to develop my career and become a successful mental health nurse.

  I now split my time between gaining further on-the-job experience, university, and placements. My role is incredibly varied, and I’m delighted to be in a position where I can achieve and encourage others towards, success.


Background information

The nursing degree apprenticeship funding will be made available at the start of this academic year 2020 to 2021 for existing apprentices or when the apprentice starts their placement with the employer.

The additional apprenticeship funding was announced on 8 July as part of HMT’s ‘A Plan for Jobs 2020’. The payments will be in addition to the existing £1,000 payment the government already provides for new 16 to 18 year-old apprentices, and those aged under 25 with an Education, Health and Care Plan – where that applies.

Details on ‘A Plan for Jobs’ additional funding for employers of apprentices under the age of 25 is available on GOV.UK.

This includes the £450,000 project to repair the Hereford flood wall.

Hereford’s riverside flood wall is a key part of the flood protection for the town and scaffolding is now in place to allow our consultants safe access. They will be surveying the extent of the damage to the brick cladding before work on repairing the damage can begin.

The repair work will begin as soon as we understand the extent and nature of repairs needed. The scaffolding will remain for the duration of the repairs.

Richard Henderson, Asset Recovery Manager for the Environment Agency, said:


  This is a significant project to repair an area of the cladding on the Hereford flood wall. It poses quite a challenging project for our contractors to reach the damage, hence the need to erect the scaffolding. However, there is no damage to the core of the wall.

  Repairing this flood defence asset will help to strengthen the flood wall and make a big difference to reducing the risk of flooding to the local area.

  The sheer volume of water in rivers in the February floods put pressure on many of our flood defences. Since then, where possible, and, whilst adhering to government guidance, our teams have been inspecting defences to check for any damage and the need for any repairs, so that we can ensure they are ready for any future floods. We have also used drone footage to help with the process.

The government is bringing forward fundamental changes in the draft Building Safety Bill that will improve building and fire safety, so that people will be, and will feel, safer in their homes.

The Grenfell Tower fire in West London on 14 June 2017 claimed 72 lives. The tragedy exposed serious failings across the whole system of building and managing high-rise homes.

We took immediate steps to make residents safer, and asked Dame Judith Hackitt to carry out an independent review of building regulations and fire safety to understand the causes of the fire.

The review concluded that the whole system needed major reform and that residents’ safety needed to be a greater priority through the entire life cycle of a building – from design and construction, through to when people are living in their homes.

The government accepted the review’s recommendations and this draft Bill, which, alongside the existing Fire Safety Bill and fire safety consultation will set out how we are bringing forward those proposals to provide the biggest improvements to building safety in nearly 40 years.


Read the draft Building Safety Bill


What is a draft Bill?

A draft Bill is published to enable consultation and scrutiny before the Bill is introduced to Parliament.

The draft Building Safety Bill will be examined by a Parliamentary committee who will report with feedback and recommendations before the Bill is finalised. We will also work with stakeholders on areas that need refinement or further consultation to finalise measures.

The Bill will then be introduced formally in the House of Commons or the House of Lords. If it progresses through all stages in Parliament, the Bill will then be presented to the Queen for her formal agreement where it then becomes an Act and the powers come into force.

What does it mean for residents?

We are putting measures in place to make people safer in their homes. The draft Bill will ensure that there will always be someone responsible for keeping residents safe in high rise buildings – those 18 metres and above. They will also have to listen and respond to residents’ concerns and ensure their voices are heard – they will be called the ‘Accountable Person’.

Residents and leaseholders will have access to vital safety information about their building and new complaints handling requirements will be introduced to make sure effective action is taken where concerns are raised.

To oversee all this and make sure that Accountable Persons are carrying out their duties properly, there will also be a new national regulator for building safety, within the Health and Safety Executive.

It will ensure that high rise buildings and the people who live in them are being kept safe and will have new powers to raise and enforce higher standards of safety and performance across all buildings. The regulator will appoint a panel of residents who will have a voice in the development of its work.

We are committed to making sure that leaseholders won’t pay unaffordable costs for historic repairs to their buildings. We will continue to engage with stakeholders, including leaseholders, on this issue while the draft Bill is being scrutinised.

We will be speeding up work with the finance and insurance industries, to protect leaseholders from unaffordable costs of fixing historic defects, but without relying on taxpayers’ money.

We will also address insurance issues around building safety. A new ‘building safety charge’ will make it easy for leaseholders to see and know what they are being charged for when it comes to keeping their building safe. But, to make sure that these costs are affordable, we have deliberately included powers to limit the costs that can be re-charged to leaseholders.

For the first time, new build homebuyers will have their right to complain to a New Homes Ombudsman, protected in legislation, and developers will be required to be a member of the scheme. The New Homes Ombudsman will hold developers to account, including the ability to require developers to pay compensation.

Together, measures in the draft Building Safety Bill, Fire Safety Bill, and Fire Safety Order consultation will improve safety standards for residents of all blocks of flats of all heights, with even more stringent approaches and oversight for buildings in scope.  

What does it mean for the industry?

The draft Bill will make sure that those responsible for the safety of residents are accountable for any mistakes and must put them right. It will fully establish the regulator that will enforce new rules and take strong actions against those who break them.

The regulator will have 3 main functions: to oversee the safety and standard of all buildings, directly assure the safety of higher-risk buildings; and improve the competence of people responsible for managing and overseeing building work. 

It will operate a new, more stringent set of rules for high-rise residential buildings. The new set of rules, contained in the draft Bill, will apply when buildings are designed, constructed and then later occupied.

At each of these 3 stages, it will be clear who is responsible for managing the potential risks and what is required to move to the next stage enabling a ‘golden thread’ of vital information about the building to be gathered over its lifetime.

When residents move into a building that falls under the new set of rules, it will need to be registered with the Building Safety Regulator and apply for a Building Assurance Certificate. The Accountable Person will need to conduct and maintain a safety case risk assessment for the building and appoint a Building Safety Manager to oversee it day to day. 

Building inspectors who are responsible for signing buildings off as safe for people to live in will also have to follow the new rules and must register with the regulator.

The draft Bill will also give the government new powers to better regulate construction materials and products and ensure they are safe to use.

What else has the government done?

The government is doing its part in bringing forward the legislation but the industry, which has fed into these reforms from the start, must now lead the way.

However, we have not stood still and the work we are doing so far is already improving the safety of buildings so people are safer in their homes.

We have banned the use of combustible materials on the external walls of high-rise buildings, published clearer guidance on existing regulations that buildings owners must follow, and we are making it mandatory for sprinklers to be fitted in all new blocks of flats over 11 metres high.

We identified buildings with unsafe Aluminium Composite Material (ACM) cladding and are providing £600 million to remove and replace it in both private and social-sector homes over 18 metres high. We are also providing £1 billion to remove and replace non-ACM cladding materials from high-rise residential blocks.

As part of our response to the report from Phase 1 of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry, we have introduced the Fire Safety Bill to Parliament. This gives local fire and rescue services the power to make sure building owners deal with potential fire risks in their building.

Next steps

The draft Bill will be published on Monday 20 July as the government is keen for it to receive further views from parliamentarians, residents and industry via the Parliamentary process of pre-legislative scrutiny, before the Bill is then introduced to Parliament.

Funds to help ensure 15,000 people continue to have a safe place to stay and are helped into long term accommodation
  Jenrick praises ‘remarkable national effort’ to protect vulnerable during pandemic


The next step in the government’s plans to help ensure some of the most vulnerable people in society continue to have a roof over their heads and are helped into long term accommodation was launched today by Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick.

From today (18 July 2020), councils and their local partners can apply for funds from the government’s Next Steps Accommodation Programme to cover property costs and support new tenancies for around 15,000 vulnerable people who were provided with emergency accommodation during the pandemic.

This programme now takes total government support for homelessness and rough sleepers to over half a billion pounds. This will help ensure as few people as possible helped off the streets and into accommodation during the pandemic return to sleeping rough and help to break the cycle of homelessness for good.

A total of £105 million is now available to ensure interim accommodation and support continues for those who need it and can be used to help people move into the private rented sector, extend or secure alternative interim accommodation or where possible help people to reconnect with friends or family.

In addition, first wave funding, totalling £161 million, is also available to provide 3,300 additional supported homes this year for those currently housed in emergency accommodation. This is part of a total of £433 million to provide 6,000 long term, safe homes for those in need.

This funding is part of the response coordinated by Dame Louise Casey, who has been leading the COVID-19 Rough Sleeping Taskforce. Expert advisers will also be available to support local partners develop their plans for accommodation and related support services.

Last week official statistics showed that the combined efforts of central and local government, the NHS, charities and other partners to get people off the street and into safe accommodation has helped protect the most vulnerable in society and save lives.  

Secretary of State for Housing Robert Jenrick MP said:


  The remarkable national effort to support rough sleepers and vulnerable people during this crisis has protected many lives and I am hugely grateful to all those involved. 



  We now have a landmark opportunity to break the cycle of rough sleeping and ensure that people do not return to a life on the streets.



  Today I am launching the funding to ensure that vulnerable people and rough sleepers continue to have a roof over their heads and are helped into longer term accommodation, enabling them to start to rebuild their lives.


Minister for Rough Sleeping and Housing, Luke Hall MP said:


  There has been a colossal effort from our councils, charities and partners to provide a protective shield for the most vulnerable during this pandemic.



  Their efforts must not be in vain and today’s release of funding will make a huge difference by preventing thousands from returning to the streets with further support to allow them to rebuild their lives with a roof above their heads.

New laws to bring biggest improvements to building safety for a generation
  Regulator to raise standards, enforce new laws and give louder voice to residents so building owners ensure their safety
  Fire safety consultation seeks views on proposals to implement recommendations from Grenfell Tower Inquiry and strengthen Fire Safety Order


The government is set to publish its landmark Bill to deliver the biggest changes to building safety for nearly 40 years and make residents safer in their homes.

The Building Safety Bill, to be published in draft form on Monday (20 July 2020), will improve regulations as the government seeks to bring forward a clearer system with residents’ safety at the heart of it.

Residents have helped to develop the proposals through engagement groups, and under the new rules, people living in high rise buildings will be empowered to challenge inaction from their building owner and have better access to safety information about their building and will benefit from a swift and effective complaints process.

A Building Safety Regulator, already being set up within the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), will be fully established and equipped with the power to hold building owners to account or face the consequences. 

It will enforce a new, more stringent set of rules that will apply for buildings of 18 metres or more or taller than 6 storeys from the design phase to occupation.

The government views the draft Bill as legislation that will evolve as further evidence and risks are identified to ensure that residents’ safety is always prioritised and will also provide new powers to better regulate construction materials and products to ensure they are safe to use.

Government expert Michael Wade has been asked to work with leaseholders, and the finance and insurance industries. He will test and recommend funding solutions to protect leaseholders from unaffordable costs of fixing historic defects, ensuring that the burden does not fall on tax payers. He will also develop proposals to address insurance issues around building safety.

The draft Bill includes a new ‘building safety charge’ to give leaseholders greater transparency around costs incurred in maintaining a safe building – with numerous powers deliberately included to limit the costs that can be re-charged to leaseholders.

It comes as the government will also publish a consultation on Monday, which sets out proposals to implement the recommendations from Phase 1 of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry that require a change in law.

The consultation will also look at strengthening fire safety in all regulated buildings in England to ensure that people are safe from fire regardless of where they live, stay or work. Taken with the draft Bill, these measures will improve the safety of residents in buildings of all heights.

Housing Secretary Rt Hon Robert Jenrick MP said:


  This is a significant milestone on our journey to fundamentally improving building safety and delivering real change that will keep people safer in their homes.

  I remain committed to making sure we get this right, which is why I will be publishing the draft Bill for scrutiny and improvement before it is introduced in Parliament.

  I am also calling on the industry to actively prepare for these changes now. It is vital that the sector moves in step with us, to provide confidence and reassurance to residents that their safety is firmly at the heart of everything we do.


Building Safety and Fire Minister Lord Greenhalgh said:


  As a government we are determined to learn the lessons from that fateful night at Grenfell Tower and ensure that a tragedy like this does not happen again.

  These are the biggest changes to building safety legislation for nearly 40 years, and they will raise standards across the industry and ensure building owners have nowhere to hide if they break the rules.

  Consulting on key recommendations from the Inquiry and wider changes to fire safety regulation will give those affected the opportunity to make their voices heard and help us implement lasting, significant change.


Independent advisor and author of the Independent Review of Building Regulations and Fire Safety, Dame Judith Hackitt said:


  I welcome this draft Bill as an important milestone in delivering the fundamental reform this industry needs to make residents and buildings safer.

  It meets the ambitions and recommendations set out in my review.

  And industry must be in no doubt that it is not enough to wait for the Bill to become law before they implement changes; we expect them to start taking action now.


The government is also announcing that full applications for the £1 billion Building Safety Fund, to remove unsafe non-ACM cladding from buildings, can be submitted from 31 July – with 747 registration forms processed since 1 June. 

To also ensure that building owners are clear on which steps they need to take to ensure the building is safe, we will also publish a new Manual to the Building Regulations which contains all Approved Documents in one place.

"198",2020-07-16,"Victims of terror atrocities at home and overseas are to benefit from a new dedicated compensation scheme under government plans to boost the support offered to people injured by violent crime.","
    
          

government to consult on new compensation process for victims of terror
  part of wider proposed reforms to simplify and improve criminal injuries compensation
  increased pay-outs for bereaved families


The proposals aim to better address the particular needs of victims and their families following a terrorist incident, and ensure applications are processed as rapidly as possible. The changes follow a commitment to improve the compensation process following the Manchester Arena Terror Attack, and support the government’s wider review of the support available to terror victims, including families and loved ones, to ensure more victims get the support and advice they need, faster.

The plans form part of a package of reforms Ministers are pursuing through a consultation launched today (16 July 2020) which seeks to improve the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme (CICS) – making the scheme simpler and more transparent, while ensuring it keeps pace with the changing nature of crime.

The Scheme provides compensation to victims injured by violent crime as public acknowledgement of their suffering, paying out more than £130 million last year – making it one of the most generous of its kind in the world. This includes £11 million to victims who were previously barred from accessing compensation under the pre-1979 ‘same roof’ rule after the government scrapped the unfair rule last year.

The key proposals in the consultation include:

Creating a standalone scheme for victims of domestic and overseas terrorism to improve awareness of the support on offer and ensure applications are processed as rapidly as possible.
  Scrapping completely the ‘same roof’ rule which blocks victims from receiving compensation if the attacker was a family member they were living with at the time of the incident. Ministers abolished part of the rule in 2019, which has led to £11 million being paid to victims previously denied compensation.
  Simplifying the list of injuries included in the CICS and the tariff of payments associated to them.
  Giving a single payment to bereaved families of £8,000 – an increase of £2,500 for the majority of applicants while speeding up the claims process.
  Increasing support for funeral costs to a single payment of £4,500 - from the previous basic sum of £2,500 to reflect the rise in funeral costs.
  Seeking views on whether families bereaved by homicide abroad should have access to compensation.
Justice Minister Alex Chalk said:


  All too recently we’ve witnessed the devastating effects of terrorism, which is why this government is determined that victims get the support they need to rebuild their lives.

  While no amount of compensation can ever make up for the suffering they’ve endured, our reforms will ensure the system for claiming awards better reflects the needs of victims, and that applications are processed as rapidly as possible.

  But this is only one part of our plans to boost the support available for people injured by violent crime. We are simplifying the Scheme making it easier to understand, as well as increasing pay-outs for bereaved families.


Today’s announcement follows a comprehensive review which found that for the vast majority of applicants the  Scheme is working well, with the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) which operates the Scheme reporting a 95% customer satisfaction rating.

The review concluded that the principles underpinning the Scheme must be maintained – that it exists to support all eligible victims of violent crime who have suffered the most serious injuries, and that compensation is an important and public recognition of their ordeal. It carefully considered the Scheme’s scope and eligibility criteria, and while it recognised concerns around application time limits and the unspent conviction rule, it found that any change would undermine the Scheme’s ethos of treating all victims in a fair and consistent manner.

However, the review revealed some areas where improvements could be made, including to reduce the complexity of the process – which can deter some from applying – as well as enhancing the support offered to victims. Ministers are therefore consulting on package of changes which would inform the detail of a new and improved Scheme.

The move builds on commitments to improve the support on offer at every stage of the justice system outlined in the first-ever cross-government Victims Strategy as well as a raft of reforms to protect victims and pursue perpetrators. This includes:

a 50 per cent increase in funding for victims of sexual violence.
  abolishing the pre-1979 ‘same roof rule’ which has paid out £11 million to new and past applicants.
  consulting on a new Victims Code setting out what support victims should expect from the justice system.
  Improving court environments, with new victim-friendly waiting areas and an emphasis on accessibility for the most vulnerable.
  Extending the Unduly Lenient Sentence so more victims and the public can have sentences reconsidered by the Court of Appeal.
Notes to editors

The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme (the Scheme) is a statutory scheme that exists to compensate victims of violent crime in Great Britain where no other option of financial redress is available.
  A consultation will run from 16 July to 9 October 2020.
  The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) deals with over 30,000 applications a year, and has a high satisfaction rating of 95% from applicants who had been in contact in 2018/19.
  In 2018/19 the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) paid out more than £130 million to victims.
  The review examined whether the Scheme remains fit for purpose, reflects the changing nature of violent crime and effectively supports victims in their recovery.
  It considered:
    The scope of the Scheme, including the definition of violent crime for the purposes of compensation for injury, and the type of injuries that are covered by the Scheme.
      The eligibility rules including, among other things, concerns about time limits for making applications, unspent convictions, and consent in sexual offences cases.
      The requirements of the Scheme in relation to decision-making, including issues such as the level of evidence required for compensation claims, and the timeframes for accepting or rejecting awards.
      The value and composition of awards available through the Scheme, including the balance struck between serious and less serious physical and mental injuries.
      The impact of the Scheme on particular groups, including victims of child sexual abuse and victims of terrorism.
      Opportunities to simplify the Scheme.
      The affordability and financial sustainability of the Scheme.
    
  The Scheme operates a tariff-based system for determining injury awards which describes the qualifying injuries and the associated awards. Our proposals will simplify this list of injuries and awards to achieve more transparency and consistence for victims.
  ‘Same roof’ rule
    The rule was intended to ensure perpetrators would not benefit from compensation paid to victims they lived with.
      In 2019 the pre-1979 ‘same roof’ rule was abolished. This meant victims of violent crimes which took place before 1979 were blocked from receiving compensation if the attacker was someone they were living with at the time of the incident.
      However, the post 1979 ‘same roof’ rule remained intact. The changes recommend abolishing this rule completely, so that familial relationships will not prevent victims from accessing compensation to which they would otherwise be entitled, provided that there is no possibility of the assailant benefitting.
      An amended Scheme coming into force on 13 June 2019. The changes allow victims previously denied criminal injuries compensation under the rule, or who have never applied, to make fresh applications; applications must be received by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) within two years, by 13 June 2021.
    
  Victims of domestic terrorism can already claim from CICS and Victims of FCO-designated terrorist attacks abroad can claim compensation from the Victims of Overseas Terrorism Compensation Scheme.
  A standalone scheme for victims of terrorism would require primary legislation.
  The consultation also explains rationales for not changing certain aspects of the Scheme. This includes:
    The scope of the Scheme and whether it could be extended to include crimes of grooming, online exploitation and grooming.
      The review found that expanding to such crimes could present operational difficulties given the wide range of other offences that may also have similar harmful impacts and operation difficulties in establishing evidence.
    
  The government is also reviewing the wider support available to victims of terrorism, including families and loved ones, and investing £500,000 to increase the support provided, to ensure more victims get the support and advice they need, faster.
  The Home Secretary made an announcement on the 26 March regarding a competed grant, available to organisations who want to provide support to victims of terrorism. Organisations were able to bid for up to £500,000, to provide advice and support to individuals and their families affected by terrorist attacks. The outcome will be announced shortly.
  The government has committed to an internal review of the wider support package available to victims of terrorism. The review is currently being scoped and we will take forward its recommendations in due course.

"199",2020-06-17,"A pioneering scheme to provide new antibiotics to NHS patients by offering to pay pharmaceutical companies upfront for their work will start this week.","
    
          Government offers contracts to develop new antibiotics to treat deadliest diseases
  NHS patients could benefit from new antibiotic treatments as early as 2022
  New drugs will be paid for by world’s first ‘subscription-style’ payment model for antibiotics
The NHS is offering 2 contracts to pay pharmaceutical companies at the start of their work for access to innovative antibiotics, incentivising them to bring new classes of the drugs to patients across the UK for the first time in almost 30 years.

Of particular interest are antibiotics that can provide alternative treatment options for serious infections, such as bloodstream infections, sepsis and hospital-acquired pneumonia.

The high cost and low returns associated with antibiotic research and development makes it commercially unattractive. This is why the drugs will be paid for by the world’s first ‘subscription-style’ payment model for antibiotics and will be made available to UK patients as soon as possible, potentially as early as 2022.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said:


  The incredible discovery of antibiotics nearly 100 years ago transformed the health of our nation and our ability to combat infections. Diseases that were once a death sentence are now treated in just one small step.

  But resistance to antibiotics is increasing and it’s imperative we take urgent action on a national and global scale to protect future generations.

  This new way of buying antibiotics for patients in the NHS breaks down restrictive barriers to offer companies a vital springboard to foster innovation and develop potentially life-saving new products.


Professor Dame Sally Davies, UK Special Envoy on Antimicrobial Resistance, said: 


  Antibiotics underpin modern medicine and are integral for global health security. Governments and industry must work together to produce new antibiotics and ensure that we can continue to treat common diseases.

  The UK is leading the way by encouraging companies to produce new antibiotics to stay one step ahead of life-threatening diseases.


The payment model, which was launched in July 2019, will pay pharmaceutical companies upfront for access to their antibiotic product, based on a product’s value to the NHS, rather than how much is used.

This aims to incentivise companies to invest in researching and developing new antibiotics, helping secure much-needed alternative treatment options for NHS patients.

Two drugs that have proven to be both safe and effective will be selected to undergo health technology assessment (HTA) by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) throughout 2021 using adapted methods for antimicrobials. The HTA will be used to decide the level of the subscription payment.

From this week, suppliers can register their interest for the scheme on NHS England’s eTendering Service.

The UK is at the very forefront of the global fight against antimicrobial resistance (AMR), launching its 5-year national action plan in 2019 and setting out its vision for AMR to be contained and controlled by 2040.

Yet, tackling AMR will require a global effort and the government is today calling for other countries to offer similar incentives in their own domestic markets.

Professor Stephen Powis, National Medical Director, NHS England said:


  Staff across the NHS are already working with patients to ensure the antibiotics we have are used in the right way at the right time, and this new scheme is further important progress to develop new, life-saving antimicrobial medicines.

  People’s lives depend on us having effective antibiotics and steps like this further reinforce how the NHS is leading the way in efforts to safeguard against the rise of superbugs.


Professor Gill Leng, Chief Executive, NICE, said:


  We are witnessing the effects of one global pandemic, which has highlighted the threat of communicable disease.  Alongside the threat of coronavirus is the increasing risk posed by antimicrobial resistance, exacerbated by a sparse antimicrobial development pipeline.

  That is why we need to incentivise investment in innovative antimicrobial drug development as soon as possible. Along with our key partners, we have committed to develop and test innovative models for the evaluation and purchase of antimicrobials, applying advanced evaluation methods that recognise their full value to public health.

  We hope that this project will inspire healthcare systems across the world to consider adopting similar models so that collectively, we deliver meaningful incentives that reinvigorate the global antimicrobial pipeline.


Background information

The need to address the urgent issue of bringing new antimicrobials to market is widely recognised. Few new classes of antibiotic have been discovered since the 1980s and, for most antimicrobials, there are few replacement or alternative products in development and even fewer that target priority pathogens.
  The high cost and low returns associated with research and development of novel antimicrobials makes it commercially unattractive. In addition, pharmaceutical company revenues depend on volume of sales, potentially undermining antimicrobial stewardship initiatives.
  The UK is the first country in the world to announce it will test innovative models that pay companies for antimicrobials based primarily on a health technology assessment of their overall value to the NHS, as opposed to the volumes used.
  The subscription-style payment model will mean the NHS will have new drugs to call on when needed, while companies will be able to reliably forecast the return on their investment.
  A notice will be published on the Official Journal of the European Union website in the next 2 to 5 days.
  Once the notice is live, suppliers can register their interest via https://nhsengland.bravosolution.co.uk. Instructions and selection criteria will be published as part of this notice. Once released the procurement documents can also be found on the NICE website.
  Two procurement exercises will be run in parallel: one for an antimicrobial recently introduced to the UK market, and a second for a new antimicrobial with plans to launch in the UK before January 2021.
  The selection process has been designed to favour products which meet a key need in the UK while also addressing disease areas of international importance. Points will also be awarded for degree of novelty, surety of supply, the supplier’s demonstrated commitment to antimicrobial and environmental stewardship, and commitment to support surveillance.
  Products will be selected by the end of this year, and these selected products will progress to the HTA stage in 2021 to estimate the value of each product to the NHS. Contracts for the 2 antibiotic products are due to start in April 2022.
  The scope of the current procurement is the NHS in England. The expectation is that, if the project is successful, future rollout of these purchasing arrangements could be UK-wide.

"200",2020-06-11,"A consultation event is being held via zoom for the local community about plans to protect properties in Skeldergate from flooding","
    
          People living in the Skeldergate area of York are being invited to take part in a virtual consultation event next week to find out more about plans to better protect the area from flooding.

Environment Agency staff are holding the event on Thursday 18 June, at 6.30pm, to answer any questions from residents and business representatives about proposals to offer protection to individual properties against the risk of flooding. The protection will include fitting products such as flood doors, barriers and airbrick covers to properties that are found to be suitable following a free survey.

These products known as Property Flood Resilience (PFR) are used to reduce the risk of flood water getting in to homes or businesses and, in some instances, to reduce the damage if it does get in.

A study was carried out by consultants employed by the Environment Agency, as part of the York Flood Alleviation Scheme, to look at the best option for reducing flooding in Skeldergate.

Some of the options examined by the consultants were constructing floodwalls along the Ouse, waterproofing building walls and fitting floodgates across the access points from Skeldergate to Queens Staith. The study looked at the benefits of each option in terms of the numbers of properties protected and compared to the development and construction costs. It concluded that the only viable option to reduce the risk of flooding in Queens Staith and Skeldergate is to provide PFR measures to eligible properties.

Initially the plan was to hold a public drop-in event to share the findings with the local community but due to Government guidance on social distancing restrictions relating to the coronavirus outbreak, a decision has been made to trial holding an event remotely.

The virtual live event will be held using the Zoom platform. The details are: 
Meeting ID: 837 5064 2927
Password: YorkB7
Or use this link

If you have any questions about the meeting email: yorkfloodplan@environment-agency.gov.uk

Mark Fuller, flood risk adviser with the Environment Agency, said:


  Although we cannot currently meet members of the local community in person, we are still keen to give them the opportunity to speak to our project team about the results of our findings and discuss any concerns with us. Our priority is the health, safety and wellbeing of residents and staff.



  Flooding can never be eliminated entirely, but by using property flood protection we may be able to reduce the risk of water getting in to homes or businesses and reduce its impact if it does get in.


There have been 40 residential and 10 commercial properties in the Queens Staith and Skeldergate area identified as being eligible for a free PFR survey to look at what measures are recommended as offering the best protection. If owners want to go ahead with the recommendations they will be offered a grant of up to £7,500 to install resistance measures to their properties.

This work forms part of £45 million York Flood Alleviation Scheme, which will better protect 2,000 homes in the city from flooding.

Progress continues to be made with the construction of York Flood Alleviation Scheme as work is being carried out where safe to do strictly adhering to Government guidelines. Every effort is being taken to ensure any delays caused by the effects of the pandemic are kept to a minimum.
