#### Packages ####
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggfortify)

#### Import Dataset ####
authority_data_cleaned <- read_csv("Day3/DataWrangling/outputs/authority_data_cleaned.csv")




#### Principle Component Analysis ###############
# We do not need all the variable let's create a new data frame with only the one we want
PCADataset<-authority_data_cleaned[,c(1:3,15,16,7:11,13)]# subset the columns we want by position
PCADataset$SIMDQuint<-as.character(PCADataset$SIMDQuint)# make sure that the SIMD quintile is correctly encoded 
PCADataset$SIMDDecil<-as.character(PCADataset$SIMDDecil)# make sure that the SIMD decile is correctly encoded 

# Selecting columns with numerical components (those 6-11) to make a new data frame ####
measures <- PCADataset[,c(6:11)]#so I am selecting all rows and the columns from the fifth to the tenth
View(measures)# let see the new data set 

#### Computing the PCA of the numerical measures ####
pcs <- prcomp(measures) #defining a new object called pcs that will run a principal components analysis of our numeric variables
pcs
plot(pcs)


#### Create a data frame copied from sites and including the PC values ####
pcdata <- PCADataset #creating a new data frame named pcdata containing all the variables that were on the original authority data 
pcdata$pc1 <- pcs$x[,1] #creating a new variable named pc1 that will contain all the pc1 values (all rows and the first column of the pcs list)
pcdata$pc2 <- pcs$x[,2]#creating a new variable named pc2 that will contain all the pc1 values (all rows and the second column of the pcs list)
View(pcdata)

#### Plotting 
#plot with ggplot
ggplot(pcdata, aes(x=pc1, y=pc2, color=location)) + #use pc1, pc2 and colour code by period
  geom_point(size=6, alpha=0.5)+# use scatter plot and set size to 6 and 50% transparency
  theme_bw()+ # white background
  labs(title = "PCA")+ #add a title
  geom_text(aes(label = authority),hjust=0.5, vjust=-0.5) # adds authority labels

autoplot(pcs, data=PCADataset, colour='location', alpha=0.5, loadings=TRUE,loadings.label = TRUE, loadings.colour = 'black',loadings.label.colour= 'black')+
  theme_bw()



autoplot(pcs, data=PCADataset, colour='location', alpha=0.5, loadings=TRUE,loadings.label = TRUE, shape=FALSE, loadings.colour = 'black',loadings.label.colour= 'black')+
  theme_bw()+
  geom_label(aes(label = authority, hjust=0.5,vjust=0.5, colour=location))# this time we are not using ggplot but we are using autoplot within ggfortify and we are leaving the system to decide which type of graph to plot 
#The loadings arrows will identify which are the variables that more impact the differences across the groups


# Practical 1
# Look at Impact on different deprivation areas

#### K-Means Clustering ####

numGroups = 2 #how many groups I expect in my data set
myKMeans <- kmeans(measures,numGroups)#define a new variable named myKMeans that will apply the kmeans function on our measures using the number of groups we decided at the start
myKMeans

#### Adding cluster number to each site in a new data frame and plotting ####
kmeandata <- pcdata #again we start by copying our old data frame 
kmeandata$cluster <- myKMeans$cluster # we are now adding a new variable named cluster that will contain the info about in which cluster the system put that specific site 
# and now we are going to plot the result
ggplot(kmeandata, aes(x=pc1, y=pc2, col=location)) + #use pc1 as x pc2 as y and colour code by period
  geom_point() +# use a scatter plot 
  facet_wrap(~cluster)+ #subplot by the cluster value
  theme_bw()+# white background
  geom_label(aes(label = authority, hjust=0.5,vjust=0.5))

ggplot(kmeandata, aes(x=pc1, y=pc2, col=location)) +#use pc1 as x pc2 as y and colour code by period
  geom_point() +# use a scatter plot 
  facet_grid(location~cluster)+ #subplot by the cluster value and period
  theme_bw()+# white background
  geom_label(aes(label = authority, hjust=0.5,vjust=0.5))
