## Summer School Format
o The Summer School is meant to be interactive, and you will be prompted to replicate what the instructor is demonstrating on your own machine.

o Besides the instructors, there will be helpers present in the call who are there to help you if you get stuck or if you run into an error. Please use your sticky notes to raise problems or issues and someone will help you with addressing it. During the introduction at the start of the Summer School we will cover how to ask for help in more detail.

o We promote an inclusive and welcoming environment, so we ask you to be respectful towards our instructors, helpers and fellow participants. Disruptive behavior will not be tolerated, and you will be asked to leave if it occurs. More information can be found in the Summer School Code of Conduct Document.
